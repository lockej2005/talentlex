-------Example application 1:

I recently encountered complications with my health, specifically managing chronic fatigue caused by my autoimmune disease, ulcerative colitis. I was diagnosed at 16 and, throughout my schooling, I had to balance studies with visits to the hospital for infusions of immuno-suppressant drugs. Fatigue and chronic tiredness were side-effects I needed to manage carefully. Recently, I faced a similar challenge after switching to a new immuno-suppressant drug. The ongoing fatigue returned, impacting my ability to perform at full capacity in my role as a Parliamentary Assistant. This presented a significant challenge as I am responsible for managing the a high volume of correspondence which my MP recieves. I was initially concerned about how to maintain my productivity, manage my health, and meet the expectations of my role. To overcome this challenge, I ensured that I communicated openly with my employer about my condition and the side effects of the new medication. This allowed us to implement practical adjustments, such as arranging flexible working hours and scheduling critical tasks on my higher-energy days. I prioritised my work by identifying the most urgent and complex pieces of correspondence from constituents, ensuring I focused on these when I had the mental and physical capacity to give them my full attention. Additionally, I delegated some lower priority, such as the monthly Newsletter and social media posts to my colleagues. Through this experience, I developed strong organisational skills, I learnt the importance of balancing multiple priorities and maintaining open lines of communication, both of which are crucial in a legal career with client deadlines, collaborative work with colleagues, and rigorous attention to detail. This experience also pushed me to develop my communication skills, as I had to be open and honest about my disability, which can often be embarrassing and difficult to talk about.

-------Example application 2:
I faced a significant setback during my ABRSM Grade 8 piano exam. Having always passed my previous music exams with high distinctions, it was disheartening to only barely pass this one. The exam required me to perform three pieces, play scales and arpeggios from memory, and complete sight-reading and aural tests. However, during my performance of Beethoven's "Rondo: 3rd Movement from Sonata in E", I experienced a memory lapse and forgot the next notes. This brief pause lowered my score and hindered the rest of my performance as my nerves got the better of me. Though I passed, I was disappointed and felt like I had failed. Instead of dwelling on my mistake, I sought feedback from the exam board and focused on preparing for my upcoming Grade 8 cello exam. I realised that I had not prepared under simulated exam conditions and had underestimated the higher marking standards Grade 8 level examiners used. Determined not to repeat the same mistake, I extended my cello practice sessions and included full run-throughs under mock exam conditions, often requesting friends and family to pose as examiners. This thorough preparation paid off, and I performed confidently in my cello exam. I achieved the highest distinction mark, with a notable improvement in the aural test from a score of 18/30 to 27/30. Reflecting on the experience, I recognised the importance of mental preparation and stress management. While my actual practice was thorough, I had again run the risk of nerves affecting my performance under pressure. If I could go back, I would incorporate strategies like breathing exercises early in my preparation. Ultimately, this experience taught me that setbacks are growth opportunities. By embracing challenges and learning from my mistakes, I have learnt that perseverance leads to success.
