You are an applicant to the law firm Sidley Austin for their vacation scheme. You are drafting an application to the question ‘Why does a career in commercial law and specifically Sidley Austin interest you? (250 words)’. Below are some prompt-completion pairs trained on previous notes jotted down by applicants and the actual applications they produced. You will be given some notes for your New Application, for which you need to similarly create a draft application based on the notes.

Below are the prompt-completion pairs to train on:

Prompt-Completion Pair 1:
Prompt (Notes for application):

Why law (as much detail as you need, the more the better): Interested in commercial aspects of law, intellectual stimulation of legal research

Key reason(s) for applying to firm: Sidley Austin’s expertise in private equity, Sidley Austin’s role in GIC’s $8.4b leveraged buyout of Genesee & Wyoming Inc, Sidley Austin’s international reach, Sidley Austin’s FinTech & Payment Services

Relevant experience: drafted an NDA for a major PE firm at Weil, interned in Latham & Watkins’ Structured Finance Department

Relevant interaction with firm (if any): Sidley Austin’s Open Day, met Managing Associate Tanaan Quek

Any other information you’d like to include: Did iBM’s Data Science course

Completion (Draft application):
Commercial law attracts me as it involves commercially-driven legal analysis. During my internship in Weil, Gotshal & Manges’ Private Equity (PE) department, I actively participated in a transaction by drafting a NDA for a major PE firm, following their specific guidelines. I enjoyed thinking strategically about the commercial priorities of various transaction parties and how they are skillfully negotiated. Joining Sidley Austin (Sidley) would allow me to work alongside sophisticated PE clients, especially given Sidley’s accelerated growth in PE. Particularly, I am attracted by Sidley’s unparalleled ability to leverage its FinReg expertise in PE deals. Notably, Sidley’s role in advising GIC’s $8.4b leveraged buyout of Genesee & Wyoming Inc showcased how Sidley’s regulatory group was a critical value-add in addressing significant regulatory scrutiny across numerous jurisdictions—demonstrating Sidley’s capacity to handle international complexity. This aligns with my international outlook and legal ambition.

I also relish the intellectual rigour of legal research and its practical application. During my internship in Latham & Watkins’ Structured Finance department, I enjoyed researching legal provisions and translating my findings into practical client advice regarding novel issues. Sidley presents numerous opportunities to engage in similarly unprecedented matters. Attending Sidley’s Open Day drew me to its market-leading sectoral strength in FinTech & Payment Services, a differentiator which Managing Associate Tanaan Quek highlighted allows Sidley’s lawyers to become industry experts. Completing IBM’s Data Science Course also cultivated my interest in the legal implications of FinTech companies. The opportunity to actively research new regulations to contribute to groundbreaking deals at Sidley attracts me.


Prompt-Completion Pair 2:
Prompt (Notes for application):
Why law (as much detail as you need, the more the better): I am attracted to commercial law because of the blend between technical expertise and big-picture thinking. In my degree, I most enjoy applying the law to novel scenarios. At Duncan Lewis, I shadowed an unfair dismissals case and was intrigued by how the legal decision unsettled the working culture and led to poor business performance. Commercial lawyers combine these activities as they need to anticipate market changes while using the law to help manage a client company’s risk. 

Key reason(s) for applying to firm: Sidley Austin’s values and growth opportunities

Relevant experience: N/A

Relevant interaction with firm (if any): Sidley Austin’s BME Open Day, Cambridge University Sidley Dinner (met Neil Gravenhorst who spoke about private equity and insurance), met Fatema Orjela at Open Day

Any other information you’d like to include: led a free GCSE tuition scheme for underprivileged students in Year 10, organised Sikh Society ACCESS conference at Cambridge

Completion (Draft application):
I am attracted to commercial law because of the blend between technical expertise and big-picture thinking. In my degree, I most enjoy applying the law to novel scenarios. At Duncan Lewis, I shadowed an unfair dismissals case and was intrigued by how the legal decision unsettled the working culture and led to poor business performance. Commercial lawyers combine these activities as they need to anticipate market changes while using the law to help manage a client company’s risk.

I am attracted to Sidley both because of its values and attitude towards growth. After attending Sidley’s BME Open Day, it was clear that your firm’s inclusive culture aligns with my personality. I saw how initiatives, like the Committee on Retention and Promotion of Women, provide support for underrepresented groups. In Year 13, I headed a free GCSE tuition scheme for disadvantaged students whilst at University I organised the Sikh Society ACCESS conference. Therefore, I believe this is a working culture where I would thrive but also be able to contribute toward. At the Cambridge University Sidley dinner, Neils Gravenhorst explained that Sidley has recently used its expertise in life sciences and insurance to build out its private equity team through strategic lateral hires. On the open day, partner Fatema Orjela emphasised that these growing teams in the London office aren’t clouded by the historical weight carried by other firms. This excited me as it means that lawyers are encouraged to contribute to the team’s business direction at an early stage. 

Based on these notes, which are similarly structured to each of the prompts in the prompt-completion pairs above, draft an application answer to the question ‘‘Why does a career in commercial law and specifically Sidley Austin interest you? (250 words)’, similar to each of the completions. Use every part of these notes to structure your draft. Where a section says ‘N/A’, ignore that part of the notes and focus on the rest. In the training data applications, identify the information in the applications related to Sidley (research the applicant has done on Sidley, including recognitions, deals and other firm facts) and use these to aid your completion where relevant (focusing on information that was not personal to the applicant).
