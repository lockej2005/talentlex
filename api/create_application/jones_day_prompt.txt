Prompt (Notes for application):
Why law (paste your full ‘why law’ here):
I was initially interested in black-letter law through Oxford’s Summer Courses, which I substantiated through my internship in disputes. However, qualifying as a top 8% semi-finalist in Aspiring Solicitors’ Commercial Awareness Competition developed my enthusiasm for transactional law. This summer, creating value for an investment firm by proofreading documents helped me understand how legal knowledge empowers companies and a lack thereof can impede growth. Practising commercial law at Jones Day (JD) would provide the flexibility to mitigate real risks for everyday businesses through my use of language whilst exploring contentious work.

Why Jones Day (interactions with the firm, key reasons for applying etc…):
Non-rotational training structure, interacted with Trainee Patricia Owino, ‘One Firm Worldwide’ motto, firm achieving ‘Most Recommended’ firm for the 20th consecutive time, Corporate M&A and Restructuring Practice

Why you (any relevant personal reasons):
Great understanding of business

Any relevant experiences: drafted SPAs and Term Sheets at Virtus and secured 3 long term contracts, entrepreneurial mindset (improved profitability of LSE’s Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu society by 230% and 650%)

I was initially interested in black-letter law through Oxford’s Summer Courses, which I substantiated through my internship in disputes. However, qualifying as a top 8% semi-finalist in Aspiring Solicitors’ Commercial Awareness Competition developed my enthusiasm for transactional law. This summer, creating value for an investment firm by proofreading documents helped me understand how legal knowledge empowers companies and a lack thereof can impede growth. Practising commercial law at Jones Day (JD) would provide the flexibility to mitigate real risks for everyday businesses through my use of language whilst exploring contentious work.

JD attracts me due to its non-rotational training structure. I reached out to Trainee Patricia Owino, learning of how she tailored her training contract to make the most of her experience. By actively seeking work in healthcare, energy and renewable transactions at Virtus, I proactively liaised with clients to understand their businesses when drafting their SPAs and Term Sheets. I helped secure 3 long-term cash flow sources simultaneously by working on ventures that genuinely interested me.

Moreover, I read about JD’s ‘One Firm Worldwide’ philosophy which renders partners responsible for each other’s net worth. Further, JD’s 20th consecutive achievement of ‘Most Recommended’ firm, highlighted to me its emphasis on placing client needs first.

Considering these factors, the prospect of working in JD’s market-leading practices, such as Corporate M&A and Restructuring, deeply excites me. My proactive nature would allow me to excel at JD while contributing effectively to its non-hierarchical structure.

My unique understanding of clients’ business angles enables me to provide tailored advice, through my experiences of corporate transactions on the client’s and firm’s side. My entrepreneurial spirit also aligns with JD’s ‘go-getter attitude’. As an Executive of LSE’s Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) Society, I skyrocketed profitability and female participation by 230% and 650%, by personally iterating marketing campaigns.

Why law (paste your full ‘why law’ here):
Having experienced a range of legal sectors, including administrative and criminal law, I have been drawn to a career in commercial law. When creating the ‘Statement Sensei’ startup, I found the challenge of maintaining competitive pricing whilst trying to increase profitability incredibly stimulating. I hope to pursue a career in commercial law because it would enmesh my academic interest in the law with concepts like profitability and competitiveness.

Why Jones Day (interactions with the firm, key reasons for applying etc…):
Private equity strength (example iQ Student Accomodation Deal for £4.66 billion), non-rotational TC

Why you (any relevant personal reasons):
Entrepreneurial attitude (Vice President of Cambridge Sikh Society)

Any relevant experiences:
Secured long-term agreements through a sponsorship drive, increasing the society’s funding from £1000 to £5000 per year, worked as a careers secretary for Cambridge Law Society, hosted private dinner with Dominic Grieve QC liaising with Browns restaurant

Dear Graduate Recruitment,

Having experienced a range of legal sectors, including administrative and criminal law, I have been drawn to a career in commercial law. When creating the ‘Statement Sensei’ startup, I found the challenge of maintaining competitive pricing whilst trying to increase profitability incredibly stimulating. I hope to pursue a career in commercial law because it would enmesh my academic interest in the law with concepts like profitability and competitiveness.

I am attracted to Jones Day’s strength in private equity. This expertise is demonstrated by the firm’s role in the UK’s largest-ever private real estate transaction involving the sale of iQ Student Accommodation for £4.66 billion. As clients are well-accustomed to the acquisition process, private equity deal flows are very fast. I would relish the opportunity to work on these transactions as it would allow me to develop faster as a lawyer.

Your firm’s entrepreneurial culture aligns with my personality. The non-rotational training structure allows trainees the freedom to approach the teams they want to work for. I developed an entrepreneurial attitude as Vice-President of Cambridge Sikh Society. I sought to ensure the society’s permanence, rather than it coming into and out of existence. Consequently, I led a sponsorship drive focused on securing long-term agreements rather than one-off donations, increasing the society’s funding from £1000 to £5000 per year.

Jones Day’s strong international presence means that most of the work takes a multi-jurisdictional character. Therefore, lawyers must collaborate both across practice areas and international offices. Working as a Careers Secretary for Cambridge Law Society has allowed me to develop these teamwork skills. I recently hosted a talk and private dinner with Dominic Grieve QC, which required me to liaise with Dominic’s team, Browns restaurant and other departments including speakers, publicity and creative.

Yours Sincerely,

Why law (paste your full ‘why law’ here):
My interest in commercial law was initially built through my legal internships in Lebanon. I drafted legal documents such as service letters for the corporate team. This enabled me to gain an understanding of drafting and develop my attention to detail. To pursue my interest in commercial law, I undertook a vacation scheme at Allen & Overy (“A&O”). This confirmed my ambition to pursue a career as a commercial solicitor.

Why Jones Day (interactions with the firm, key reasons for applying etc…):
Expertise with financial markets, non-rotational training contract, supportive culture, diversity as a woman

Why you (any relevant personal reasons):

Any relevant experiences:
Sat at Clifford Chance’s Global Financial Markets seat, ESG and green deal financings, collaborating with various teams at A&O, Debate Mate (taught 70 yearly debating sessions)

My interest in commercial law was initially built through my legal internships in Lebanon. I drafted legal documents such as service letters for the corporate team. This enabled me to gain an understanding of drafting and develop my attention to detail. To pursue my interest in commercial law, I undertook a vacation scheme at Allen & Overy (“A&O”). This confirmed my ambition to pursue a career as a commercial solicitor.

I am applying to Jones Day for three key reasons. Firstly, the firm’s expertise in Financial Markets sparked my interest. For example, the Firm advised TotalEnergies on its financing of the $18.5 billion RGLNG Project. This was particularly interesting having sat in the Global Financial Markets department during my Clifford Chance vacation scheme. I was keen to participate in several green financing deal closings enhancing my research skills. I learned how ESG factors are influencing the legal sector, which was evident in this deal.

Secondly, I am drawn to Jones Day’s non-rotational training contract. This approach allows trainees to independently develop their style of working and gain exposure to substantial work from an early stage. After my experience collaborating with various teams at A&O, I found myself interested in a variety of practice areas. Thus, my interest in generalist training drew me to Jones Day’s non-rotational approach. This independence-driven training suits me based on my experience as a Debate Mate mentor. I taught 70 debating sessions yearly with secondary school children which allowed me to develop my teaching style. I also actively sought additional responsibility to cover for other mentors.

Thirdly, I value Jones Day's supportive culture. Jones Day's Firmwide Women's Affinity Group highlights a working environment that embraces diversity and supports the retention and progression of women lawyers. This motivates me further to pursue a career at Jones Day.

N/A

Why Jones Day (interactions with the firm, key reasons for applying etc…):
Non-rotational, commitment to client service

Why you (any relevant personal reasons):
Team player, leadership experience managing teams of 4-150 people,

Any relevant experiences:
Internship at A&O Hanoi supporting Corporate and Banking teams, client-facing position at Citizens Advice, informally running university elections, vacation scheme at Faegre Drinker

Completion (Draft application):
I am interested in Jones Day due to the firm's distinctive non-rotational training system. During my internship at A&O Hanoi, I was assigned to support the Corporate and Banking teams simultaneously and enjoyed seeing how they collaborated as the powerhouse of the office. Being able to compare both practices and follow a deal from multiple strategy perspectives gave me a challenging and comprehensive learning experience, which is something I am excited to replicate at Jones Day. The firm’s range of specialist areas also allows me to seek work in personal interest areas – energy, projects and infrastructure – while also benefitting from a strong corporate and finance background.

As a team player with varied leadership experience managing teams of 4 to 150-people under high pressure, I am equipped with the entrepreneurial, case management, and communication skills to assist deal teams and proactively find new learning opportunities during my training contract at Jones Day. Being someone who is driven by curiosity and planning to gain further academic background in geopolitics and natural resources to supplement my legal career, I also believe that my approach to development aligns with Jones Day’s emphasis on willingness to learn.

I am moreover impressed by Jones Day’s recognised commitment to client service and delivery. In my previous client-facing positions at Citizens Advice and informally at university running an election service, I have learned to understand and adapt to the client’s objectives and enjoyed achieving tangible success for and with clients. I am also detail-oriented and committed to excellence as demonstrated by my academic track record and reviews from my vacation scheme at Faegre Drinker. Exposure to Jones Day’s continuing work for reputable clients and their complex business objectives will allow me to showcase and develop this potential and contribute to the firm’s fundamental values.

Prompt (Notes for application):
Why law (paste your full ‘why law’ here):
My interest in commercial law is derived from my internships at commercial law firms. During an internship at Steptoe & Johnson, I completed Trainee tasks on an M&A transaction. Whilst conducting due diligence, I enjoyed understanding the multi-faceted aspects of transactional law. The work involved different stakeholders with various individual challenges. I liked the complexity this added to the deal as I am interested in the overlap between the commercial world and the law. Demonstrating this, I competed in the Aspiring Solicitors Commercial Awareness Competition 2021/22, where I finished in the top 4% of over 3000 candidates.

Why Jones Day (interactions with the firm, key reasons for applying etc…):
Non-rotational training contract, private equity, lean teams

Why you (any relevant personal reasons):
Like working in international offices (mom from South Africa and dad from India)

Any relevant experiences:

Demonstrating this, I competed in the Aspiring Solicitors Commercial Awareness Competition 2021/22, where I finished in the top 4% of over 3000 candidates.

I am drawn to Jones Day’s non-rotational training contract because it creates an individual training experience offering exposure to the areas that interest me most. I have developed an interest in the private equity sector evidenced by authoring an article entitled ‘The effect of Covid-19 on private equity and the law firms accompanying it’. This distinctive training will deepen my understanding of transactional law by experiencing the full lifecycle of a deal without interruption. Being able to work on the same deal across different departments appeals to me because it provides a contextual insight not found at other firms.

Additionally, I am attracted to the lean teams because I can engage with difficult client work from the start. I am excited to learn on the job as the steep learning curve will enhance my skillset making me a better lawyer. My mum originates from South Africa and my dad originates from India. Therefore, I have developed a cultural sensitivity and passion for international work. My background will allow me to excel at Jones Day because the firm focuses on achieving seamless integration across its offices. Resultantly, I would be able to work on cross-border and multijurisdictional deals that develop my international awareness.

Why law (paste your full ‘why law’ here):
I am a first-class Psychology graduate applying for Jones Day’s Winter Placement scheme.
My initial interest in commercial law was sparked after participating in the Social Mobility Legal Placement. I was involved in a competition where I advised a client on data regulation. We encountered a range of commercial problems, such as the implementation of the GDPR. To solve this issue, I suggested that we review the client’s data collection system to check for potential breaches before the implementation date. As a result, our team successfully made it to the semi-finals of the competition. These early experiences piqued my interest in commercial law.

To solve this issue, I suggested that we review the client’s data collection system to check for potential breaches before the implementation date. As a result, our team successfully made it to the semi-finals of the competition. These early experiences piqued my interest in commercial law.
Importantly, Jones Day’s strength in corporate M&A work has drawn me to apply here. As I am currently working as a real estate paralegal at Osborne Clarke, I enjoy the complex and fast-paced nature of transactional work and watching the development of property deals. Similarly, I am also interested in following M&A cases. The corporate M&A practice at Jones Day stands out due to its full spectrum of financing and merging abilities, and its reputation as ranking ‘Tier 1’ in Legal500 2022. Whilst attending the Aspiring Solicitors diversity law, I spoke to trainees and learnt that the London corporate practice is expanding rapidly. I want to gain first-hand experience of the developing corporate work while on the scheme.
Furthermore, the unique non-rotational training contract means that work is not restricted within departments. I find this appealing because whilst interning in a lab, I was able to pick up matters that I found interesting and tailor my research. Likewise, a training contract at Jones Day would allow me to work in practice areas for much longer and develop my expertise.
Thank you for taking the time to read my cover letter.
Yours faithfully,

This refined my understanding of the type of firm I wish to work in: international in reach, working for impactful clients and allowing for higher levels of responsibility in a collegiate environment.

Jones Day seems to reflect the factors I am drawn to. Its dedication to a ‘one firm worldwide’ approach allows it to seamlessly address complex multijurisdictional deals with more agility. This provides exposure to clients whose activities drive transformations worldwide. I was able to discuss their impact with partner Emily Stew (during the Open Evening), describing how ESG matters are increasingly incorporated into most transactions, a meaningful change I wish to contribute to.

The firm’s unique non-rotational training model allows trainees to enjoy greater flexibility to address deals holistically. They work proactively to meet key responsibilities, essential for professional growth as I discovered when being entrusted a research project under the KURF independently.

Additionally, my extracurricular experiences equipped me with key tools required to enter the legal profession. Working at the Language Resources Centre allowed me to deepen team-working skills as we collaborated to effectively advertise the Centre’s resources. I was also able to enhance problem-solving abilities when raising funds for the Three Peaks Challenge during the pandemic. Finally, dealing with challenges has always been a driver for me. For instance, managing university and a part-time job, whilst being part of two student society committees and practising sports was extremely enriching. I wish to bring my own enthusiasm about challenges to the forefront of my involvement with JD.

During this internship, I marked-up a non-disclosure agreement and advised Barclays on the structure of a corporate transaction. This experience reassured me that the work was something I was interested in as I gained insight into how transactions are structured from a legal perspective.

Due to my interest in finance, Jones Day’s (JD) stellar reputation in the financial sphere is what drew me to the firm. My interest in finance is evidenced from interning at Lighthouse Capital, during which I formulated the investment teaser of a project financing transaction for two oil refineries in Nigeria and appraised a state’s prospectus for an Islamic bond issuance. Through the expertise of its various finance-related practices, JD advises on the most distinguished financial transactions. For instance, JD’s private equity practice recently advised KKR on its series B funding of One Stream Software, whilst its financial markets and real estate team recently advised Goldman Sachs on the largest-ever private real estate sale of IQ Student Accommodation to Blackstone. Being a part of this legal environment would be rewarding for my career as I could contribute towards the development of the global commercial landscape. Moreover, participating in JD’s non-rotational training contract would enable me to immerse myself in all aspects of similar financial transactions.

Having conversed with trainees at JD, I learnt that the non-rotational training contract favours those who are proactive and excel when offered autonomy due to the onus on trainees to obtain their own work. This system of training enthrals me, as I thrived when I was granted the autonomy to create the investment teaser at Lighthouse Capital for which I received positive feedback from my supervisors for my work.

I appreciated the interdisciplinary nature of commercial transactions, realising they have social and political implications. Conducting legal research and due diligence highlighted the integral role of legal advice for companies. Such experiences have cultivated a genuine interest in transactional and contentious areas of law.

I am attracted to Jones Day’s (JD) Global Disputes practice due to the variety of work stemming from commercial arbitration to cross-border litigation. During my summer internship I approached the Litigation team to work on a fascinating case where we sought to curtail an individual’s right of return as he had defaulted on loans. I attempted to formulate creative arguments using foreign judgements. It was immensely fulfilling to get involved in work I found genuinely engaging.

Undoubtedly JD’s non-rotational training structure appeals to me. During my internship I took the initiative to approach Partners in the Corporate team to get exposure in transactional areas of law. I assisted with amending a company’s Information Security Policy to align with new Indian gaming laws. I admire JD’s culture of bestowing high levels of responsibility upon trainees as it allows for them to maximise exposure across departments. My proactivity would allow me to benefit vastly from JD’s training contract.

JD has a commitment to cross-practice and cross-office client engagement which allows them to provide effective legal advice. Volunteering for a social enterprise in Portugal, required me to collaborate with European students to formulate a solution to sanitary issues. It taught me how to build good relations with people from different backgrounds. Being able to work effectively in a diverse team aligns with the ‘One Firm Worldwide’ philosophy which would allow me to excel at JD.

Completion (Draft application):
Dear Graduate Recruitment,

I hope this cover letter finds you well.

My desire to pursue this opportunity stems from my interest in Jones Day’s practice areas, as well as the unique training contract structure the firm offers.

Volunteering at a legal clinic, I gained insight into the legal system and was particularly interested in dispute resolution. Liaising with creditors and seeking to avoid legal action, I developed my ability to communicate on behalf of a client to reach an adequate. I am eager to gain deeper exposure in this field through Jones Day's global disputes practice - the 'One Firm Worldwide' structure and high-profile work offer an unparalleled opportunity to strengthen my skills and learn from top lawyers worldwide. Given developments such as a rise in third-party litigation funding and proposed changes to the Arbitration Act 1966, I am eager to contribute to helping clients navigate these challenges as part of Jones Day’s leading team.

The non-rotational training contract furthers my desire to pursue a career at Jones Day. This system allows trainees to follow a transaction across every stage; experiencing this through the virtual job simulation, I found that this heightened my commitment to the project and my sense of pride in my output. Additionally, this would enable me to build a stronger relationship with clients, bolstering my ability to understand and address their demands and deliver exceptional client service. Lastly, this system harbours a more collaborative and supportive atmosphere as trainees work with a wide range of colleagues; the expectation of trainees to ‘walk the floors’ means associates and partners are far more approachable compared to typical law firms. These benefits would enable me to maximise my professional growth and development as a trainee at Jones Day.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
