-------Example application:

I love Boxing, and I’ve practiced the sport since I was 13. I love boxing because its complex technical demands push me to constantly improve, while building my confidence and resilience both inside and outside the ring. While at university, I earned a Bronze Medal in the novice category at the BUCS Boxing Championships, balancing intense training with my studies. From 2022 to 2023, I served as Club Captain of LSE Boxing, managing over 350 members, organising three weekly training sessions, and leading the successful LSE Fight Night, which sold over 1,300 tickets and generated £32,000. This role required organising referees, security, paramedics, and AV technicians, as well as providing mentorship to new fighters. This role required exceptional organisational skills as I led a team which coordinated referees, security, paramedics, and AV technicians and support staff at the venue. I also provided mental health support to new fighters, ensuring they felt confident in the ring. These qualities directly translate to a legal career, where balancing competing priorities, managing clients, and displaying resilience under tight deadlines will be critical. I also served as Education Officer on the executive team of my student union. I won the election with a majority of 750 votes. During my tenure, I campaigned for equitable academic policies, addressing complex issues like unequal regulations and student rights – experiences that mirror the advocacy lawyers provide for their clients. I identified the key issues of unequal academic regulations between departments and the deadnaming of trans students on their diplomas as key issues to resonate with voters. Whilst in the role, I had a 1-1 relationship LSE’s Vice-Chancellor for Education which honed my interpersonal skills. These qualities directly translate to a legal career, where communicating with clients and confidently discussing their businesses will be essential in providing effective legal advice.
