-------Example application:

I recently encountered complications with my health, specifically managing chronic fatigue caused by my autoimmune disease, ulcerative colitis. I was diagnosed at 16 and, throughout my schooling, I had to balance studies with visits to the hospital for infusions of immuno-suppressant drugs. Fatigue and chronic tiredness were side-effects I needed to manage carefully. Recently, I faced a similar challenge after switching to a new immuno-suppressant drug. The ongoing fatigue returned, impacting my ability to perform at full capacity in my role as a Parliamentary Assistant. This presented a significant challenge as I am responsible for managing the a high volume of correspondence which my MP recieves. I was initially concerned about how to maintain my productivity, manage my health, and meet the expectations of my role. To overcome this challenge, I ensured that I communicated openly with my employer about my condition and the side effects of the new medication. This allowed us to implement practical adjustments, such as arranging flexible working hours and scheduling critical tasks on my higher-energy days. I prioritised my work by identifying the most urgent and complex pieces of correspondence from constituents, ensuring I focused on these when I had the mental and physical capacity to give them my full attention. Additionally, I delegated some lower priority, such as the monthly Newsletter and social media posts to my colleagues. Through this experience, I developed strong organisational skills, I learnt the importance of balancing multiple priorities and maintaining open lines of communication, both of which are crucial in a legal career with client deadlines, collaborative work with colleagues, and rigorous attention to detail. This experience also pushed me to develop my communication skills, as I had to be open and honest about my disability, which can often be embarrassing and difficult to talk about.
