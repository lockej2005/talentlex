-------Example application:

Throughout my time at university and in my role as a Parliamentary Assistant, I have developed strong analytical skills and attention to detail. At university, I would regularly have to complete essays on disparate topics such as the rise of the AfD in Germany and the History of Evil. Equally, as a Parliamentary Assistant, I have been responsible for reviewing pieces of legislation, speeches to be delivered by my MP and correspondence to colleagues and external stakeholders such as constituents and think tanks. Throughout both experiences, I have cultivated close attention to detail. For example, I was responsible for drafting 150 letters to constituents following the winter fuel payment cut, requiring immaculate attention to detail. Furthermore, when drafting a remembrance speech for my MP, I researched local archives to include the individual stories of soldiers commemorated at the memorial where she was speaking, to ensure that my speech was both detailed and emotionally resonant. As a trainee, strong attention to detail is essential when drafting correspondence to clients, colleagues and opposing counsel as well as when filing specific technical documents on behalf of clients. Furthermore, when I completed a 1-month internship at a German Media production and distribution company in Munich, I developed strong interpersonal skills and flexibility. I lived and worked in a brand-new city, without friends or family to support me. It was also one of the first times that I experienced work in an office environment, compounding the difficulty of the situation. This experience pushed me to develop my interpersonal skills, as well as my language skills, to overcome the language and cultural barriers I faced. I regularly would invite other interns to lunch, and organised trips with them to local landmarks. I also went boxing with my manager, bonding over our shared love for the sport. As a trainee at Ashurst, I will rotate between 4 different teams over the course of the training contract, meeting new teams and consistently building new relationships.
