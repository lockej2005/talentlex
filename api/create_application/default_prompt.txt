Sidley Austin training contract review 2024-----------------------------------------------------

The Firm
Among Sidley’s greatest achievements, we’d highlight its world-class reputation in hedge funds, its status as one of the top ten highest-grossing law firms in the world, and its role in producing one of the world’s best power couples (the Obamas). Beyond the firm’s numerous notable alumni, Sidley Austin’s gargantuan reach of 22 global offices makes a startling impression. With 2,400 lawyers around the world, “it sometimes feels unimaginably enormous,” says training principal Patrick Harrison.

“We are most known for private equity work.”

It’s fair to say that Sidley Austin is more of a household name in its native US, where you’ll find half of its offices (opening most recently in Miami) and dozens of Chambers USA  rankings. The London office is the largest of Sidley’s four European bases, housing 350 lawyers and for the last three years in a row, it’s recorded double-digit revenue growth.Harrison gives us a sense of its coverage, highlighting litigation and arbitration, employment, regulatory, life sciences, tax, and “all aspects of finance” as some of the areas of work on offer. “Within that breadth, we are most known for private equity work, and that’s really picked up in the last six years,” he tells us.Sidley earns recognition from Chambers UK for investor representation and hedge funds, as well as payments law, data protection, insurance, and capital markets in London.

Of course, Sidley’s “reputation for having some of the highest calibre of work” was a juicy draw for incomers, but it was also the size of the intake: “Having 12 to 15 trainees suits how you’re going to learn.” That is to say, “a lot of learning by doing.” As one elaborated, “within two weeks of being in a seat, I was involved in a big deal!”
