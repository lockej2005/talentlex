Sidley Austin training contract review 2024-----------------------------------------------------

The Firm
Among Sidley’s greatest achievements, we’d highlight its world-class reputation in hedge funds, its status as one of the top ten highest-grossing law firms in the world, and its role in producing one of the world’s best power couples (the Obamas). Beyond the firm’s numerous notable alumni, Sidley Austin’s gargantuan reach of 22 global offices makes a startling impression. With 2,400 lawyers around the world, “it sometimes feels unimaginably enormous,” says training principal Patrick Harrison.

“We are most known for private equity work.”

It’s fair to say that Sidley Austin is more of a household name in its native US, where you’ll find half of its offices (opening most recently in Miami) and dozens of Chambers USA  rankings. The London office is the largest of Sidley’s four European bases, housing 350 lawyers and for the last three years in a row, it’s recorded double-digit revenue growth.Harrison gives us a sense of its coverage, highlighting litigation and arbitration, employment, regulatory, life sciences, tax, and “all aspects of finance” as some of the areas of work on offer. “Within that breadth, we are most known for private equity work, and that’s really picked up in the last six years,” he tells us.Sidley earns recognition from Chambers UK for investor representation and hedge funds, as well as payments law, data protection, insurance, and capital markets in London.

Of course, Sidley’s “reputation for having some of the highest calibre of work” was a juicy draw for incomers, but it was also the size of the intake: “Having 12 to 15 trainees suits how you’re going to learn.” That is to say, “a lot of learning by doing.” As one elaborated, “within two weeks of being in a seat, I was involved in a big deal!”

Covington context:------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This prestigious US import is making a splash in London’s life sciences and technology scene.

Covington & Burling training contract review 2024

The Firm
“Covington is different to a lot of other American firms,” one trainee told us. “For one thing, it’s headquartered in Washington DC as opposed to New York, which means it has access to a very different sort of client base, and that really sets the tone of the firm.” After ten decades in DC, Covington & Burling has built a big reputation at the intersection of law and public policy. In fact, after President Obama’s inauguration in 2009, Covington partner Eric Holder became the Attorney General of the United States. But wherever you find yourself, the firm’s focus on heavily regulated sectors like tech and life sciences has brought plenty of that emphasis across the pond. Here in the UK, Covington bags top-tier Chambers UK rankings in both transactional & regulatory life sciences and public affairs, alongside strong showings in data protection & information law and product liability.

“…it has access to a very different sort of client base, and that really sets the tone of the firm.”

While the smaller intake was a big draw for trainees, the current cohort was quick to emphasise that London wasn’t simply a satellite office for Covington’s practices in the US. As one source put it: “The firm has tried since the beginning to keep the small-firm atmosphere here in the London office, while maintaining the reputation of a prestigious law firm standing on its own two feet.” In fact, 100% of survey respondents at Covington indicated that they felt the firm added value to their CV, and with good reason. Covington’s recent work includes client names such as Microsoft, Astra Zeneca and Meta, and the firm has represented Ukraine in its high-profile case against the Russian Federation at the International Court of Justice.

Freshfields context: -------------------------------------------------------------------------

This centuries-old stalwart keeps things fresh with short seats and plenty of pro bono. 

Freshfields trainee associate programme review 2024

The Firm
Love Island must have restarted when we came calling, because our sources were keen to tell us about the firm’s “vibes,” somethingwhich cemented their decision to train at Freshfields: “The vibes during recruitment were just much better than at other firms.” It’s a pretty bold claim to take at face value from anyone, let alone a firm insider, but rest assured Freshfield’s long cultivated, top-of-the-market, magic circle status comes with receipts.  Since the firm’s inception in the mid-18th century it has cumulated a suite of teams across almost all areas of practice, now racks up over £1.5 billion annually, and continues to pile up the trophy cabinet – Chambers UK currently has the firm ranked in over 40 departments. The highest accolades go to its finance-related practices, in addition to competition, litigation, tax and public procurement. Freshfields’ international standing is reflected in Chambers Global, where the firm picks up more than 50 rankings.  

Graduate recruitment partner, Cyrus Poch, tells us that the firm is actively growing its US footprint, “so we have that domestic US work but also aim for cross-pollination between the offices.” Poch also highlights that, closer to home Freshfields has had some standout deals and has also worked on large dispute mandates. “The London office is really optimistic,” Poch grins, and nationally Freshfields’ bragging rights extend across both contentious and non-contentious practices too, including in: banking litigation; contentious financial services; non-contentious financial services; product liability and public procurement among others – a litany of practice matters that newbies get the chance to dip their toes into…

Dechert context:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Renowned for its funds and cross-border work, this global firm “nurtures your confidence and pushes you to go for it,” say trainees.  

Dechert training contract review 2024

The Firm  
There are good law firm names, then there are great ones. And for us, Dechert falls firmly in the latter. Firstly, in case you're saying it wrong, it’s not ‘de-shurt’ or ‘de-cher’ of the French variety – it’s pronounced ‘deck-urt.’ Secondly, Dechert is a Philly native, with most of its offices spread across the US, as well as another nine offices across Europe, Asia and the Middle East to add to the tally. While the firm’s New York HQ is its crown jewel, the London office wears its own crown. Recently moving to a refurbished office overlooking St Paul’s, one trainee shared that “compared to other American firms, the London branch is not simply a satellite office. We are not just supporting the US office. We have our own clients.”  

“Whenever someone wants to set up a fund, our number is probably in the top five.”  

The cross-border work of this “slightly less cut-throat American law firm” seemed to be a hit with our sources. One trainee told us that “the work we do is complex. We don’t do standard transactions; we do more stimulating and interesting work.” The work in question? Trainees commended the “funds seat which is excellent and class-leading” as well as the opportunities for international secondments to Dublin and Dubai. Chambers UK dishes out praise for the firm’s mid-market banking and finance work on the lender side and corporate financial crime in London. Nationally, Dechert scores top marks for its investment funds work. In Chambers Global, the firm is highly regarded for its UK investigations & enforcement on white-collar matters (international & cross border).

White & Case context:----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Case you hadn’t noticed, this “global brand” has been putting an international spin on the corporate world in London for over 50 years.

White & Case training contract review 2024

The Firm
There’s a whole host of reasons why people decide that they want to pursue a career in law. It’s no wonder either, given the breadth of opportunities and practice areas that are out there. For some, the law can serve as a ticket to build a cross-border career, and even see the world – if you choose the right firm, of course. With 43 offices spread across the US, South America, Europe, Asia, Australia and the Middle East, White & Case isn’t a bad place to start.

“… cross-border elements to almost every transaction.”

“It’s a firm with a truly international character,” said one trainee, adding, “it’s not just a US outpost in London; it’s a global brand.” In fact, with a whole host of guaranteed secondment opportunities and “cross-border elements to almost every transaction,” White & Case is the place to be if you fancy yourself as a bit of a jetsetter. Its international credentials are nothing new – White & Case was one of the first US law firms to establish an office outside the United States (Place Vendôme in Paris, back in 1926 if you’re interested). It was also among the first firms to migrate over to London in 1971.

Given the sheer scale of the firm, it was bound to end up with a reputation to match its size. Chambers UK awards the firm top-tier rankings in international arbitration, oil & gas, infrastructure and projects nationwide. If that wasn’t enough, the firm also scoops top rankings in London for its capital markets work in both debt and equity (something of a specialty at White & Case). There’s also a host of strong rankings in banking & finance, restructuring and commodities to boot. That’s before we even get into the firm’s global rankings, which you can wade through here.

Goodwin context:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With winning ambitions, Goodwin is a firm favoured by start-ups and private equity powerhouses alike.

Goodwin training contract review 2024

The Firm
It’s not always the case, but sometimes, to get a sense of a law firm’s capabilities, you need only look at where it’s decided to put its offices. Take Goodwin, for example. Founded by two classmates on a Boston sidewalk just over a century ago, the firm today has 16 bases around the world. Notably, many of these can be found the world’s major tech and life sciences hubs. Along with Boston, there are bases in Silicon Valley, San Francisco, and New York in the States, and beyond the US, the firm has also set up shop in South-East Asia in Hong Kong and Singapore. In 2019, Goodwin established a life sciences and technology hub in Cambridge – a well-known hotspot for tech in the UK. It’s these sorts of moves that prompted one Goodwin trainee to describe it as “a firm that’s agile and nimble.”

“It’s a huge firm trying to get huger.”

The London office is only 15 years old (that’s fairly young by law firm standards!), and in that time it’s grown to a headcount of more than 200 lawyers. To put it simply, “it’s a huge firm trying to gethuger.” It’s actually grown so much that the digs are starting to feel a little crowded. “We’re spread across three offices in London because we’ve grown too big!” Fortunately, the firm is gearing up for a move to Sancroft at Paternoster Square in early 2024. “We’re all excited to be under one roof,” trainees told us.

There are more signs of growth at the junior end in particular. Goodwin launched its training contract six years ago with an intake of just four trainees a year – today it’s more than tripled to 14. But even though the class sizes are growing, the numbers were just right for our interviewees. “After getting experience with UK firms, I wasn’t too keen on large intakes,” one shared. “With US firms, trainees get a say in their workstreams, and it’s not top down.” Trainees felt able “to gain responsibility, contribute to much larger deal documents, and get real breadth” in their experience.

Science and engineering degrees can be a plus (though it’s definitely not a prerequisite!) as this boffin attested: “I was looking to leverage my degree in applications with firms that were in that field, and Goodwin was the best fit.” Living up to its start-up smarts, Goodwin is rated as one of the best firms in the UK for venture capital according to Chambers UK, along with real estate funds. Its real estate team is also among the best in London for mid-market deals. On an international scale, Goodwin’s strong private equity expertise is recognised in Chambers Global, and that forms a major chunk of the London practice too.
