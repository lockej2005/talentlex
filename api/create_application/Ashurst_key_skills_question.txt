-------Example application 1:

Throughout my time at university and in my role as a Parliamentary Assistant, I have developed strong analytical skills and attention to detail. At university, I would regularly have to complete essays on disparate topics such as the rise of the AfD in Germany and the History of Evil. Equally, as a Parliamentary Assistant, I have been responsible for reviewing pieces of legislation, speeches to be delivered by my MP and correspondence to colleagues and external stakeholders such as constituents and think tanks. Throughout both experiences, I have cultivated close attention to detail. For example, I was responsible for drafting 150 letters to constituents following the winter fuel payment cut, requiring immaculate attention to detail. Furthermore, when drafting a remembrance speech for my MP, I researched local archives to include the individual stories of soldiers commemorated at the memorial where she was speaking, to ensure that my speech was both detailed and emotionally resonant. As a trainee, strong attention to detail is essential when drafting correspondence to clients, colleagues and opposing counsel as well as when filing specific technical documents on behalf of clients. Furthermore, when I completed a 1-month internship at a German Media production and distribution company in Munich, I developed strong interpersonal skills and flexibility. I lived and worked in a brand-new city, without friends or family to support me. It was also one of the first times that I experienced work in an office environment, compounding the difficulty of the situation. This experience pushed me to develop my interpersonal skills, as well as my language skills, to overcome the language and cultural barriers I faced. I regularly would invite other interns to lunch, and organised trips with them to local landmarks. I also went boxing with my manager, bonding over our shared love for the sport. As a trainee at Ashurst, I will rotate between 4 different teams over the course of the training contract, meeting new teams and consistently building new relationships.

-----Example application 2:

Given the huge part it has played in my life, I have a strong interest in music. Aged 12, I auditioned for Britain's prestigious National Children's Orchestra, and I was delighted to be accepted. I stayed on the scheme for many years, regularly attending residential camps to prepare for large concert performances at memorable venues, including the Royal Festival Hall. I also achieved several of my personal goals, including being appointed as co-leader of the entire cello section. This and other experiences, including raising money by busking in the streets of Cambridge, have shaped my current passion for music. To relax, I listen to all kinds of music, with reggaeton and electronic dance music being my current go-to's. Sport is another hobby of mine, having played hockey and cricket at an elite level for many years. Aged 11, I first played hockey at school, having never picked up a hockey stick before. After years of hard work, I accomplished some of my proudest achievements. I excelled when playing for the East of England and was then selected to trial for the England U18 team. I also captained my school team to a top 5 finish in the country. Currently, I still play hockey competitively, representing my university's hockey club as a 1st team player. I also played county cricket, competing against and alongside some of the nation's best players who now play professionally. Long-distance running is a hobby I have recently taken up. I run up to 30 km a week and have completed several half marathons. I particularly enjoy running socially, often joining forces with family members and friends on my runs. My sister and I have set ourselves the goal of completing a marathon soon, so I spend much of my free time training for this.

-----Example application 3:

After winning an election campaign, I became the social secretary of my university's hockey club. My responsibilities have strengthened my ability to build and maintain relationships and negotiate effectively. For example, I had to organise a club dinner in a restaurant for 60 members. I successfully negotiated a 20% discount to address members' concerns about affordability. The key was my flexibility and willingness to collaborate. In return for the discount, I offered to promote the restaurant on our social media pages. The relationship I had built up with the owner showed when the club was welcomed back at the same discounted price. Negotiation is a key skill for any commercial solicitor, but communicating well with others is particularly important at Ashurst. At the Ashurst in Action event, trainee Tom Segev praised Ashurst's open-door policy. He mentioned the firm's emphasis on proactively seeking feedback and collaborating with others. This appealed to me. I believe that my enthusiasm for communication stands me in good stead to drive my personal development at Ashurst. Flexibility is another strength I have. My time volunteering to teach extension maths sessions at a local primary school helped to develop this. I coordinated a class of 30 children and delivered challenging super-curricular activities weekly. To engage the younger audience, I simplified my language and used creative visual aids that I had assembled. I also tailored my teaching to accommodate different abilities, preparing multiple explanations for each concept. Receiving positive feedback from the children's parents following the 6-week programme was a testament to the skills I showed. Ashurst's HR manager, Elouise Essex, spoke at the Legal Cheek Law Fair about how important it is for trainees to prioritise deadlines and pivot to last-minute changes. Given my skills, I am confident that I could meet these demands.
