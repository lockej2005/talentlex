Open-Text Questions:
----------Why does a career in commercial law and specifically Sidley Austin interest you?
Commercial law attracts me as it involves commercially-driven legal analysis. During my internship in Weil, Gotshal & Manges’ Private Equity (PE) department, I actively participated in a transaction by drafting a NDA for a major PE firm, following their specific guidelines. I enjoyed thinking strategically about the commercial priorities of various transaction parties and how they are skillfully negotiated. Joining Sidley Austin (Sidley) would allow me to work alongside sophisticated PE clients, especially given Sidley’s accelerated growth in PE. Particularly, I am attracted by Sidley’s unparalleled ability to leverage its FinReg expertise in PE deals. Notably, Sidley’s role in advising GIC’s $8.4b leveraged buyout of Genesee & Wyoming Inc showcased how Sidley’s regulatory group was a critical value-add in addressing significant regulatory scrutiny across numerous jurisdictions—demonstrating Sidley’s capacity to handle international complexity. This aligns with my international outlook and legal ambition. 

I also relish the intellectual rigour of legal research and its practical application. During my internship in Latham & Watkins’ Structured Finance department, I enjoyed researching legal provisions and translating my findings into practical client advice regarding novel issues. Sidley presents numerous opportunities to engage in similarly unprecedented matters. Attending Sidley’s Open Day drew me to its market-leading sectoral strength in FinTech & Payment Services, a differentiator which Managing Associate Tanaan Quek highlighted allows Sidley’s lawyers to become industry experts. Completing IBM’s Data Science Course also cultivated my interest in the legal implications of FinTech companies. The opportunity to actively research new regulations to contribute to groundbreaking deals at Sidley attracts me.

--------Describe a current commercial issue that has interested you and explain why it interested you?
The convergence of PE firms with Web3 capabilities for tokenizing private capital has piqued my interest. Tokenization involves converting PE holdings into tradable digital securities—the ability to fractionalise these assets reduces minimum investment sizes, democratising private capital markets. Notably, exchanges like ADDX are enabling accredited investors to access blue-chip PE funds, illustrating the trend of PE firms coming down-market to pursue a larger pool of private capital and broaden their investor base. 

This issue particularly interests me as it represents a nascent intersection between blockchain technology, PE and legislative considerations, which may reshape the strategies of PE funds. I am also curious about the evolving role of platforms like ADDX, which may be used as intermediaries between private and PE funds, potentially altering their relationships. Additionally, I am interested in the evolution of private market infrastructure, especially in light of recent regulatory changes in the US. The SEC’s expanded definition of accredited investors in 2020 may grant liberal retail access to PE and private market offerings. This shift has led to predictions, such as the PERE poll's findings, indicating that retail investors could represent a larger portion of alternative fund AUM by 2025.

Consequently, PE firms, such as Sidley’s client KKR, are building internal Web3 teams to reach individual investors with different workflows and cost structures. From a legal perspective, this presents opportunities for lawyers to advise on compliance matters particularly pertaining to retail investor protection, the evolving landscape of digital assets, and the operation of private markets.

---------In your view, which personal qualities make a successful lawyer?
Successful lawyers possess strong analytical thinking in dissecting multifaceted legal issues, synthesising vast amounts of information and applying legal principles to reach logical conclusions. During my internship at Rajah & Tann, I quickly grasped the concept of scrutinising statutory language to craft persuasive arguments to tax authorities, effectively reducing a client's liability for tax evasion.

Secondly, a combination of technical legal expertise and commercial acumen is necessary to deeply understand clients’ business needs. I demonstrated this as a finalist in Linklaters' Pitch for Change competition, during which I successfully analysed a clients’ legal ESG risks and proposed tailored solutions to meet their commercial objectives, especially in consideration of a dynamic regulatory landscape. 

Moreover, effective communication is required to articulate complex legal concepts clearly and concisely in a client-centric role. During Latham & Watkins’ vacation scheme, I composed comprehensible research memos for clients by consciously avoiding technical jargon and summarising key information. 

Furthermore, proactivity and curiosity is key as clients increasingly expect lawyers to be experts beyond legal matters. I independently completed Virtual Internships with Freshfields, Weil and Ashurst to equip myself with practical legal skills, such as documentation. As a Staff Writer for UCL’s Legal Awareness Newsletter, I research and analyse current affairs from a legal perspective, broadening my knowledge across industries and sectors. 

Lastly, successful lawyers excel at managing tight deadlines and multiple workstreams, especially at a transactional firm such as Sidley. My experience organising a voluntary mentorship programme for 29 mentors and 74 mentees underscores my strong project management skills.

Open-Text Questions:
----------Why does a career in commercial law and specifically Sidley Austin interest you?
Practicing commercial law converges my intellectual curiosity and entrepreneurial spirit. While facilitating the funding of businesses at an angel investing syndicate and a search fund, I was impressed by how partners flexibly applied their commercial acumen to mitigate the multivariate risks of each venture. This inspired me to understand the life cycles of entrepreneurial deals by emulating their versatile commercial problem-solving. I applied this through an advisory lens at Mayer Brown, where I enjoyed counselling financial players on supply chain disruptions. This further fascinated me by elucidating how effective transactional lawyers tangibly mould the corporate landscape of the future.

Sidley’s award-winning finance practice impresses me as an elevation of the deals that first drew me to commercial law – promising to motivate me through the profound scale and effect of my work. Associate Dhevine Chandrapala’s description of Sidley’s lawyers as ‘commercial advisors’ further resonates with my entrepreneurial inclinations, as evident through the unique approaches I used to double the profitability of both LSE’s BJJ and Commercial Awareness societies. As a self-directed learner, the small teams and early responsibility that associate Cyril Cutinha describes provide the horizontal, entrepreneurial environment where I will be constantly challenged to grow – and thus sustainably advances my drive to cultivate an adaptable commercial perspective.


Moreover, Sidley’s support of YMCA youths complements my values, having led volunteer mentorship programmes for underprivileged students for four years. This compounds the collegiate atmosphere that associate Sam Walker illustrates, to create a culture where I can authentically contribute using my people-driven personality.

--------Describe a current commercial issue that has interested you and explain why it interested you?
The pandemic and current geopolitical tensions exposed the fragility of supply chains from an overreliance on Chinese manufacturing. At Mayer Brown, I noticed how recent efforts to fortify supply chains have been hamstrung by unavailable small-and-medium-sized intermediary suppliers. 

Under traditional supply chain financing, lenders purchase receivables owed by buyers based on their credit risk. Yet, economic shocks decrease lenders’ risk appetites, limiting financing to reputable downstream suppliers and excluding these intermediary suppliers. This is significant because intermediary suppliers are crucial to supply chains. Without them, upstream suppliers lack the inputs to manufacture products for corporate buyers, who suffer a reciprocal inability to meet consumer demand. Likewise, lenders suffer significant uncaptured market depth. 

The issue interests me as it is catalysing legal innovations like ‘deep-tier’ financing in Asia, which leverages technologies such as blockchain verification to increase capital flow transparency. Master agreements between corporate buyers and their suppliers then enable buyers to directly discharge the debt of intermediary suppliers – mitigating the risk for lenders. 

Such solutions efficiently manipulate familiar instruments like contracts alongside new technologies to expose the underlying relationships between parties – generating trust without altering the elements of the supply chain. Thus, it elegantly resolves the market inefficiency through a uniquely legal matrix. Financiers consequently capture a new market, while corporate buyers strengthen their supply chains, helping them meet consumer demand. Moreover, global law firms like Sidley Austin, which carry international expertise in tech-enabled financing arrangements, could generate enormous value by creating and administrating the deep-tier contractual framework for clients.

---------In your view, which personal qualities make a successful lawyer?
Lawyers must be entrepreneurial and adaptable thinkers. This entails a high-level understanding of different stakeholders’ objectives, thereafter applying divergent thinking to effectively manipulate legal instruments and create indispensable value for clients. In training, associate George Herring explained that proactivity in problem-solving would help one understand their contributions to the overall deal, developing this over time. I have practiced this commercial forethought through the unconventional market-segmentation strategies that I used to grow Project Cybele, LSE’s BJJ club and LSE’s Commercial Awareness society (CAS). My efforts catalysed record-breaking growth in each of these organisations. Alongside my work experience analysing businesses, this poises me to empathise with Sidley’s clients using my versatile commercial perspective.

At Mayer Brown, I learnt that lawyers must also be empathetic communicators, which is crucial to their team-based collaboration and maintenance of client relationships. For example, Gallagher’s acquisition of Willis Towers Watson assets utilised M&A, insurance, tax and IP lawyers from eight different Sidley offices. Organising jurisdictional questionnaires at Mayer Brown cultivated these collaborative skills. My interpersonal approach as safety I/C of a live missile outpost also demonstrated this, halving the accident rate through conflict mediations. Leading mentorship programmes for underprivileged students has further developed my interpersonal communication skills. Alongside my client interaction experience at Write Edge and editorial role at CAS, I learned to deliver complex concepts using engaging and digestible language. This helped me effectively advise non-legal clients at Mayer Brown, and prepares me to offer the bespoke communication required of a client-facing business like Sidley Austin.

Open-Text Questions:
----------Why does a career in commercial law and specifically Sidley Austin interest you?
My desire to become a commercial lawyer is derived from my internships at commercial law firms. At Latham & Watkins, I completed Trainee tasks on an M&A transaction. I enjoyed the investigative nature of the researching task involved with conducting due diligence because it allowed me to experience real client work. Likewise, at Kirkland & Ellis, I saw how commercial lawyers fuse business considerations within their legal advice. Having learnt this, I competed in the Aspiring Solicitors Commercial Awareness Competition 2021/22, where I finished in the top 4% of over 3000 candidates. 

Sidley’s expertise in private equity combined with the small Trainee intake is what enticed my application. At a networking event in 2022, Chloe Francis explained how transactional law is heavily associated with business cycles. Therefore, lawyers must deliver practical solutions at pace. As a former Royal Navy Cadet, I have experience working under pressure to deliver results in a small team. Accordingly, I look forward to the independent thinking Sidley expects from their Trainees. Additionally, lean teams will allow me to work closely and learn from recognised legal experts such as Adam Runcorn and Fatema Orjela. 

I have a keen interest in the private equity industry because of its high growth and sector-agnostic characteristic. Specifically, Sidley’s full-service capability allows them to advise on transactions ranging from the acquisition of Chelsea football club to the acquisition of DoodleLearning. Thus, it’s the dynamic working environment obtained from Sidley’s diversified client base which is the standout feature of the firm.

--------Describe a current commercial issue that has interested you and explain why it interested you?
A recent commercial issue that has interested me is the trend of private equity companies selling assets to themselves. It’s a type of financial engineering which rose to prominence because of large amounts of dry powder and volatility stemming from the Ukraine crisis and covid. Rather than having to find external buyers or list the company, this strategy allows the PE fund to sell the asset back to themselves. At first glance, this seems to be a great opportunity as the original investors make a return and the fund retains control of a profitable and high-performing asset.

However, the circular nature of this deal has attracted significant criticism. Amundi Asset Management’s chief investment officer has called it a pyramid scheme and it’s structure has even been compared to a ponzi scheme. In my opinion, the use of continuation funds could result in overly inflated valuations for the assets. A recent example highlighting this is Clayton, Dubilier & Rice sold their ownership stake in Belron to a special purpose vehicle they owned for 20 times its earnings. Whilst in the short term this may not be a problem, ultimately the true value of the assets will be realised. Theoretically, at that point, the latest investors (limited partners) will lose the most money, just like in a ponzi sheme.

---------In your view, which personal qualities make a successful lawyer?
As Sidley Austin has a small trainee intake, they need to be proactive in their work. I would use my gumptious personality, developed from work experience, to seek out additional work and help my colleagues. I would attempt problems myself before asking for guidance as it helps me to understand the solution in more depth. Additionally, by thinking proactively, I can manage expectations without falling behind and maintain the high standards of client service Sidley Austin are known for. 

As Sidley Austin values the individual contribution of their Trainees, communicating concisely and with clarity would be essential in all areas of my work. I would spend extra time ensuring that my emails, notes, documents etc were conveying information comprehensively.
As a trainee, I would work directly with clients on individual matters. However, commercial legal work is difficult to understand because of its technical and ever-changing nature. Consequently, I would use strong communication skills to ensure clients are well-advised. In doing this, a more trusting solicitor-client relationship develops. 

Sidley Austin uniquely encourages their Trainees to take on large amounts of responsibility. As such, I would take ownership of my work from an early stage and prioritise my time to ensure deadlines are met. From previous leadership experience, I have developed the confidence to think and work independently. I am determined to be an active lawyer that contributes to all areas of the firm. Therefore, my leadership experience would allow me to be a committed and valuable member of the London team.

Open-Text Questions:
----------Why does a career in commercial law and specifically Sidley Austin interest you?
I am attracted to commercial law because of the blend between technical expertise and big-picture thinking. In my degree, I most enjoy applying the law to novel scenarios. At Duncan Lewis, I shadowed an unfair dismissals case and was intrigued by how the legal decision unsettled the working culture and led to poor business performance. Commercial lawyers combine these activities as they need to anticipate market changes while using the law to help manage a client company’s risk. 
I am attracted to Sidley both because of its values and attitude towards growth. After attending Sidley’s BME Open Day, it was clear that your firm’s inclusive culture aligns with my personality. I saw how initiatives, like the Committee on Retention and Promotion of Women, provide support for underrepresented groups. In Year 13, I headed a free GCSE tuition scheme for disadvantaged students whilst at University I organised the Sikh Society ACCESS conference. Therefore, I believe this is a working culture where I would thrive but also be able to contribute toward. At the Cambridge University Sidley dinner, Neils Gravenhorst explained that Sidley has recently used its expertise in life sciences and insurance to build out its private equity team through strategic lateral hires. On the open day, partner Fatema Orjela emphasised that these growing teams in the London office aren’t clouded by the historical weight carried by other firms. This excited me as it means that lawyers are encouraged to contribute to the team’s business direction at an early stage.
--------Describe a current commercial issue that has interested you and explain why it interested you?
As a dementia carer, I have seen first-hand how the pandemic exposed weaknesses in the healthcare system. Thus, Amazon’s venture into healthcare intrigued me because although the sector requires refreshing, they are facing huge challenges.

Recently, Amazon launched Amazon Care and Pharmacy, attempting to create a new healthcare platform – with services like on-demand virtual doctors’ appointments that circumvent long waiting times. The company has over one million US employees on whom it can trial services. Arguably, this has come at the perfect time with the US loosening regulations relating to the kinds of care that can be administered over the internet.

However, Amazon’s strategy may face difficulties. If growth through acquiring larger companies is preferred, which previous purchases like Ring and Whole Foods indicate, competition concerns may crystalise into antitrust regulation that stymies growth. Sidley’s life sciences team has expertise in competition law, hence would be strongly positioned to advise Amazon on achieving compliance.

Alternatively, Amazon could choose to develop its interest in early-stage companies. Currently, a 4-week incubator programme for AWS exists. If this investment is scaled up, it could become very attractive to growing biotech companies. This would better the private equity equivalent because Amazon has access to existing infrastructure allowing it to offer supply chain and distribution guarantees that others cannot. Sidley clients, like KKR whose healthcare fund aims to scale up growing companies, would be challenged. Therefore, clients may pivot to seek opportunities in other sectors, away from life sciences wherein Sidley has expertise.

---------In your view, which personal qualities make a successful lawyer?
Successful lawyers are team players as complex work requires collaboration across practice areas. For example, Gallagher’s acquisition of Willis Towers Watson assets utilised M&A, insurance, tax and IP lawyers from 8 different Sidley offices. Being part of the 4-person CULS careers team strengthened my teamwork skills. We organised all the law career events at the university which required us to delegate events between us and ensure they all ran smoothly.

Lawyers must be highly entrepreneurial. George Herring explained that trainees should be proactive in finding solutions to issues and questioning their supervisors to understand how their work fits into the wider deal. Senior lawyers become successful by translating this into driving business by pitching to clients and winning mandates. As Vice-President of Sikh Society, I developed this entrepreneurial spirit. I sought to ensure the society’s permanence rather than it coming into and out of existence. I focused on financial sustainability by prioritising sponsorship agreements rather than one-off donations, increasing the funding from £1000 to £4000 over the summer alone.

Trainee lawyers must be especially determined. Their fee-earning tasks in corporate teams are often process heavy. Associate Arjun Seghal told me that typical trainee tasks, including project management and conducting due diligence, are very time-consuming. I realised my self-motivated and determined attitude as a consequence of the 4-hour round commute I took to sixth form. Despite the commute, I balanced my academics alongside playing for the football team, being part of the debate team and initiating a GCSE tuition scheme.

When providing examples, discuss how the rejected applications have made the issues identified and how successful applications have matched the strengths identified.

4) When making suggestions as to how the application could be improved, reference how a successful application did so based on the applications you remember through the above applications and the reviews, using quotations only where relevant.

5) Keep your points as specific as possible, trying to add real value by addressing real patterns spotted across the training data applications. Ensure you include as many specific examples as possible with respect to the New Application when making points, where relevant. Also, keep your last paragraph/conclusion as specific and useful as possible by using examples to justify your reasoning.

6) Try to recall as many parts of the prompts (in the above applications and their reviews) as possible. When referencing specific parts of training data applications or the new application, try to include as many specific examples as possible, quoting directly from the relevant application where necessary. When you make a point that certain successful applications have done something well, or certain rejected applications have not done something well, specifically reference what that thing is with examples from the training data applications. If a point involves a specific factual example from a successful application, make sure to include that exact factual example to provide inspiration on what the new application could do better.

7) Given the word-limits, identify which parts of the new application require the most change to reflect the most common patterns observed in successful applications. Each Open-Text Question has a word-limit of 250 words.

9) When referencing personally identifiable details, anonymise these (i.e names, specific schools etc...). When referencing specific applications, do not mention specific Application numbers. Only reference 'successful' or 'rejected' applications.
