Dear Graduate Recruitment, 

I am a penultimate year Law student at LSE, and I am writing to express my interest in applying for White & Case’s 2022 Summer Vacation Scheme.

Practicing commercial law converges my intellectual curiosity and entrepreneurial spirit. While facilitating the funding of businesses at an angel investing syndicate and a search fund, I was impressed by how partners flexibly applied their commercial acumen to mitigate multivariate risks. Emulating their versatile business analysis, I successfully identified high-potential start-ups for the syndicate and helped secure 13 committed investors to the fund by drafting its investor memorandum. This inspired me to understand the life cycles of entrepreneurial deals. I also enjoyed solving complex commercial problems through a legal advisory lens at Mayer Brown’s finance team. There, I counselled large financial players on supply chain disruptions, and worked on ground-breaking initiatives like Asian Development Bank’s ‘Deep-Tier Supply Chain Finance’. Alongside my insights from workshops at SEO London’s Corporate Law Programme, my experiences fascinated me by elucidating the importance of effective transactional lawyers – they tangibly mould the corporate landscape of the future. Thus, practicing at a top-tier commercial law firm like White & Case represents the perfect union of my personal drivers: a desire to hone my commercial expertise, and the fundamental purpose originating from the scale and effect of my work.

White & Case’s reputation as one of the world’s most international and rapidly growing London outlets first attracted me. In particular, White & Case’s award-winning corporate M&A and capital markets practices incorporate the venture-based financing that first ignited my passion for commercial law. As demonstrated by White & Case’s recent advising of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley on Ithaca Energy Limited’s £2.5 billion IPO, training at White & Case would allow me to take full advantage of the firm’s recent strategic expansion of its equity capital markets capabilities. I am also encouraged by Partner Simon Caridia’s description of White & Case’s future strategy, which focuses on private equity and technology among others. Having developed commercial acumen while evaluating an Indian agricultural technology start-up as a scalable investment prospect for investors, this strategy resonates with me as it demonstrates White & Case’s commitment to sustainable profitability. White & Case’s specialty industries complement the firm’s broad emerging markets expertise in the APAC region, where growing foreign investments to digital infrastructure developments are likely to help the firm flourish in the medium-term. Thus, White & Case’s entrepreneurial practice would best nurture my commercial adaptability.

White & Case’s distinguishing internationality aligns well with my personal and professional growth horizons. I first recognised the importance of an international perspective while pitching the search fund investors, where I assuaged their concerns of Singapore’s small domestic market by leveraging its stability and access to neighbouring ASEAN economies. Later, my experience facilitating the multi-jurisdictional release of financial products at Mayer Brown required me to collaborate with nine international offices to produce comprehensive guidance for clients. White & Case has historically established itself as the original truly international law firm by opening its Paris office to facilitate US-French trade during World War 2. Visiting White & Case at Legalcheek’s law fairs, I learned how the firm’s One-partnership model creates a global culture that gives its lawyers the advantage of integrated global exposure while facilitating exciting cross-border work. The firm’s guaranteed international secondment is unique in the industry and indicative of White & Case’s ‘pioneering’ and ‘united’ ethos. This would allow me to fully immerse myself in the global corporate environment of the future. As a Singaporean intent on moving to London, White & Case’s strengths align precisely with my goal of cultivating and harnessing my international perspective to effectively serve multinational clients.

As a self-directed learner, White & Case offers me the horizontal and entrepreneurial environment I know myself to thrive in. The firm’s recent growth establishes the strength of the value proposition which trainee Serene Reza identifies: lean, adaptable, and non-hierarchical teams. This working environment would provide me meaningful responsibility from early on, allowing me to materially perceive the role that I play in orchestrating the wider deal. Thereafter, leveraging the approachability of senior lawyers would avail me incrementally complex work and individualized feedback. This highly specific training approach is balanced by the firm’s relatively large intake compared to similarly structured US firms, which would offer me the benefits of a collegiate learning community to bolster my learning. Together with the personal advocacy opportunities at the firm’s many affinity networks, White & Case provides ample opportunities for advocacy and skills development, which I see as pivotal to accelerating my personal growth.

I would be grateful to be considered for the Summer Vacation Scheme. I believe that I share values with the firm, and that I possess the skills and grit to flourish when contributing to the world-leading practice of White & Case. 

Yours Sincerely, 
Jameson Chia

Dear the Graduate Resourcing and Development Team at White & Case,


I am a final-year History student at the University of Durham, and I am writing to apply for White & Case's winter vacation scheme to further develop my understanding of the firm’s extraordinary work and gain meaningful experience in the legal industry. I have interacted with White & Case on several occasions, such as completing the virtual internship, attending the first-year insight scheme, watching a webinar hosted by the firm's Energy team and meeting the firm at two virtual diversity law fairs. These experiences have given me the relevant knowledge regarding what distinguishes the firm from others including its global elite connections and its forward-thinking culture which champions diversity, equity and inclusion. Shadowing Holly Cook and Patrick Chindo in the Capital Markets department during the insight scheme demonstrated that trainees at White & Case are offered high levels of responsibility. This combined with the guaranteed opportunity for international secondment shows how a training contract at the firm will be varied and fulfilling. Additionally, White & Case is at the forefront of the legal industry, which is why it has advised clients such as Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners, on its recent acquisition of Valoriza Servicios Medioambientales, S.A. for a value of €734 million. This demonstrates the complexity of the firm's work, which I strive to be a part of. Simultaneously, I am enticed by White & Case's innovative nature, proven by the firm's use of artificial intelligence to assist its lawyers in developing fast turnaround times, ensuring that clients are offered the best possible service. 

My interest in law stems from my experiences at various law firms. In 2019, I began my legal journey by shadowing Jonathan Cantor, a partner at Teacher Stern. This demonstrated the constantly changing and academically enriching nature of a legal career. Following from this experience, I continued to further my understanding of a career in commercial law. This is why, I attended the White & Case insight scheme and completed the firm's virtual internship. These experiences proved how solicitors must think innovatively in order to offer clients the best possible solutions. I also attended insight schemes at DLA Piper and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. Participating in group exercises during these programmes demonstrated the collaborative nature of commercial law, and how this career champions diversity of thought which is another reason why I aim to become a trainee solicitor. These schemes, combined with the six-month Covington & Burling mentoring scheme and the Aspiring Solicitors Aspire programme, have given me an unparalleled understanding of commercial law's exciting and intellectually stimulating nature. I have also recently started the position as a campus ambassador at Durham University for Hogan Lovells. Working closely with graduate recruitment to develop a plan for marketing Hogan Lovells has further increased my exposure to the international legal environment and enhanced my ardour to practice this career.  

A career in commercial law is well suited to my skill set because it emphasises collaboration and engagement. These are competencies which I have developed throughout my time at university. Serving as Vice President of my college's diversity society and being part of the History department's, 'Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Committee', has improved my ability to collaborate and articulate my thoughts. A legal career also involves the need to empathise with others. I have developed this skill by being a governor of two Special Educational Needs schools in St Albans, where I shape their future strategies to ensure that the pupils have the best possible experience. Finally, I am a self-starter, having worked as a private tutor since my sixth-form studies and built up a significant client base with at least one student from every secondary school year group. Tutoring has improved my presentation skills and ability to communicate engagingly, which are crucial for trainee solicitors. Therefore, these experiences demonstrate how I provide a unique offering, and I am confident that I will thrive as a trainee solicitor at White & Case.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours faithfully,
Joshua Jayson

Dear White & Case Graduate Recruitment Team

I want to become a commercial lawyer because I want to empower businesses and help them achieve their goals. In 2017, I helped my mother set up her own social impact enterprise that educates children about the cultures and traditions of African countries, operating in both Ivory Coast and Italy. Through researching the Italian and Ivorian legal systems’ approaches to contract law, specifically stakeholders agreements, I witnessed first-hand how the law affects individuals and businesses; I understood how legal knowledge empowers companies and a lack thereof can impede growth. My understanding was enhanced during a month as a legal assistant in Clifford Chance’s Milan office. There, I particularly enjoyed researching the elements of a breach of contract claim and applying my findings for a client with whom I attended a meeting; I produced a comprehensive report on the client’s chances of bringing a successful claim, for which I was commended and consequently offered a second internship. From contributing to my mother’s business goals, to applying my legal knowledge to a client’s dispute, I am drawn to a career as a lawyer as it will permit me to empower my clients, their business and society at large.

My motivations to train as a commercial solicitor at White & Case are two-fold: the focus on African economic development, and its strong M&A practice.

Currently enrolled on a Development Studies MSc, I hold a particular interest in the work that the undertakes in delivering first-class work to sustainably powering Africa’s economic development. I thoroughly enjoyed reading Sibusiso Zungu, Partner in White & Case’s Johannesburg office, discussing about the energy transition and financial investments in African economies to achieve the sustainable development goals. Additionally, my Ivorian heritage and consultancy work for the Kenyan-based Wangari Maathai Foundation, was pivotal to my aspirations of working in a firm that will allow me to play a part in the legal processes that enable Africa’s economic development.

Finally, the M&A practice of the firm appeals to me. I am excited to be working on amazing cross-border and international M&A deals. White & Case’s excellence is showcased by the fact that the firm has been consistently ranked in the top 10 for deal value in leading M&A league tables for over 6 years by Thomson Reuters, Mergermarket and Bloomberg as well as number 1 for Global M&A by value. Attending Baker McKenzie’s International M&A workshop at the LawCareersNetLive 2022 event was fundamental in sparking my interest in M&A. I am fascinated by the huge impact M&A deals have and I cannot wait to successfully learn more about this practice at White & Case.

Additionally, I believe that my past experiences gave me the opportunity to acquire both soft and hard skills that will be very useful to me as a commercial solicitor. Working as a blog editor at the LSE Rule of Law Journal on Human Rights and Social Justice developed my attention to details, communication and persuasion skills. In fact, I was able to edit and write suggestions on the critical aspects of legal articles to be published on the society’s social media pages, paying close attention to grammar mistakes, the usage of accurate legal sources and academic language. I also made sure to utilise an inviting tone when suggesting the changes to be made which convinced the authors to accept all of my recommendations. Moreover, interning as a summer legal research analyst at the European Youth Think Tank allowed me to develop practical skills such as legal research and drafting letters to EU organisations like the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice. My pieces of research were utilised for the delivery of policy recommendations by the think tank which resulted in receiving high praise from my supervisors. All these experiences have helped me develop all the fundamental skills to become a commercial solicitor at White & Case LLP. 


Thank you for reviewing my application and I look forward to be hearing from you.

Yours faithfully,

Axel Beugre

Dear Recruitment Team,

My interest in law piqued after being exposed to the legal realm of real estate while working full time at an estate agency during my A-Levels. A key function of my role was leading projects heavily influenced by the law, such as ensuring compliance, landlord prospecting and valuations, networking with new tech providers and providing detailed strategy plans for clients on how to lease their properties most profitably. As an intermediary in a sales/letting transaction, I enjoyed the goal- driven negotiation process which, akin to commercial transactions, involved ensuring the best monetary deal for my client. Furthermore, having preferred the rapid environment of lettings rather
 han the longer process of a sale, I believe I am suited to the fast-paced and exciting nature of commercial transactions. I developed my ability to draft contracts with precision, stay on top of changing laws, tailor my work to specific clients and produce successful sales pitches; skills which are similarly essential when practicing law. To continue developing my practical legal skills, I have been working remotely for a legal service provider in New York that specialises in start-ups, as well as a Legal Advice Centre in London which has exposed me to the fast-paced and stimulating practical side of law. Moreover, commercial law emphasises building client relationships and a global network; as a full-time bartender alongside my current studies, I recognise that this social aspect of work is what contributes to making it fulfilling.

My motivation for applying to White & Case stems from the firm's high-quality work that is available during the training contract, such as the advisory of Goldman Sachs on a “landmark” buy now, pay later securitisation in Saudi Arabia. This is further highlighted by corporate work involving a mix of public and private work providing variety. The quality of work, accompanied by a great culture, made possible by the firm's open-door policy and relatively small trainee intake of 50, provides an excellent opportunity to training under leading experts in a supportive environment. This is supported by the firm's vast international presence, highlighted by its 44 global offices in 30 countries, which allows the firm to leverage its multi-jurisdictional strength with industry expertise that provides leading work in the field. Similarly, the firm's the availability of international secondments appeals to my multicultural background and interest in working on transnational deals. Akin to this, my multilingual ability in English, Polish and Russian will benefit me greatly within Norton Rose's collaborative culture. I will be infinitely grateful for you to consider me for a place on the Summer Vacation Scheme.

Yours sincerely,

Wiktor Mazurenko

Completion: Application 4 (Rejected):
1. Insufficient Focus on White & Case: The applicant showed limited engagement with White & Case specifically, failing to substantially detail the firm's practices, values, or specific reasons for choosing the firm over others. The mistaken reference to Norton Rose at the end suggests a lack of attention to detail and specificity.

2. Lack of Strong Legal Experience: Unlike successful applicants, this application emphasized skills from non-legal roles like estate agency work and bartending more than relevant legal experiences such as internships, shadowing lawyers, or participation in legal research projects.

3. Limited Personal and Commercial Fit: While the applicant mentioned international exposure and multilingual abilities, they did not sufficiently connect these aspects to White & Case’s values, such as their pioneering and united philosophy, or demonstrate how the applicant’s background aligns with the firm's culture.

4. Generic Motivations and Examples: The motivation section predominantly focused on the firm's high-quality work and international presence, but lacked depth. Specific interest in White & Case's unique attributes or culture, as seen in successful applications, was minimal.

5. Inconsistent Detail and Clarity: The cover letter contained grammatical errors and unclear connections between points, which compromised the overall effectiveness of the application. Specific details about relevant transactions or roles, particularly in relation to how they align with White & Case’s strategic focus, were also missing.

Some key points to bear in mind: 
1) Highlight the inferred patterns or specific issues in the rejected applications and positive aspects/successes in the accepted applications. Use all the prompt-completion pairs to do so. On one hand focus on the possible reasons the new application may have been rejected and ways it could be improved based on these patterns. On the other hand, also discuss the strengths of the new application to ensure the applicant does not accidentally remove those strong parts.

2) Tailor your feedback on the new application to be as data-driven (based on the past applications from the MemoryKey) as possible. Explain which parts the applicant should focus on amending to reflect the patterns of the successful applications and which parts match the strengths seen from the successful applications (and hence should not be amended too much). Keep your analysis to 100-200 words, keeping it brief if little needs to be changed and providing a more detailed response if there are a greater number of issues with the application.

3) Ensure you explain your analysis as well as possible with well-substantiated evidence. Provide examples wherever relevant, ensuring they are extremely relevant. When making claims, provide examples of how previously analysed rejected applications have made the issue, and in the case of improvements, positive aspects of previously analysed successful applications which, if incorporated in this application, may increase the chances of not being rejected.

4) When making suggestions as to how the application could be improved, reference how a successful application did so based on the applications you remember through the memory key, using quotations only where relevant.

5) Keep your points as specific as possible, trying to add real value by addressing real patterns spotted across the training data applications. Ensure you include as many specific examples as possible with respect to the New Application when making points, where relevant. Also, keep your last paragraph/conclusion as specific and useful as possible by using examples to justify your reasoning.

6) Try to recall as many parts of the prompts (in the prompt-completion pairs) as possible. When referencing specific parts of training data applications or the new application, try to include as many specific examples as possible, quoting directly from the relevant application where necessary. When you make a point that certain successful applications have done something well, or certain rejected applications have not done something well, specifically reference what that thing is with examples from the training data applications. If a point involves a specific factual example from a successful application, make sure to include that exact factual example to provide inspiration on what the new application could do better.

7) Identify which parts of the new application require the most change to reflect the most common patterns observed in successful applications. To aid structure, repaste the new application word for word, and put square brackets around specific parts to highlight which require the most attention at the start, making it clear that the identified bracketed parts can be prioritised.

8) Provide your response in a readable way. Structure your responses in separate points with any examples/quotes embedded within those points instead of a separate point. Write in prose and include sub-headings to signpost your points well.

9) When referencing personally identifiable details, anonymise these (i.e names, specific schools etc...). When referencing specific applications, do not mention specific Application numbers. Only reference 'successful' or 'rejected' applications.

Format all points in this structure:

[Outline issue/point]:
[Explain issue/point] with evidence from rejected applications: [Insert quote/example] and improvement suggestion [insert improvement suggestion].

(Repeat for each point)
