Commercial law attracts me as it involves commercially-driven legal analysis. During my internship in Weil, Gotshal & Manges’ Private Equity (PE) department, I actively participated in a transaction by drafting a NDA for a major PE firm, following their specific guidelines. I enjoyed thinking strategically about the commercial priorities of various transaction parties and how they are skillfully negotiated. Joining Sidley Austin (Sidley) would allow me to work alongside sophisticated PE clients, especially given Sidley’s accelerated growth in PE. Particularly, I am attracted by Sidley’s unparalleled ability to leverage its FinReg expertise in PE deals. Notably, Sidley’s role in advising GIC’s $8.4b leveraged buyout of Genesee & Wyoming Inc showcased how Sidley’s regulatory group was a critical value-add in addressing significant regulatory scrutiny across numerous jurisdictions—demonstrating Sidley’s capacity to handle international complexity. This aligns with my international outlook and legal ambition. 

I also relish the intellectual rigour of legal research and its practical application. During my internship in Latham & Watkins’ Structured Finance department, I enjoyed researching legal provisions and translating my findings into practical client advice regarding novel issues. Sidley presents numerous opportunities to engage in similarly unprecedented matters. Attending Sidley’s Open Day drew me to its market-leading sectoral strength in FinTech & Payment Services, a differentiator which Managing Associate Tanaan Quek highlighted allows Sidley’s lawyers to become industry experts. Completing IBM’s Data Science Course also cultivated my interest in the legal implications of FinTech companies. The opportunity to actively research new regulations to contribute to groundbreaking deals at Sidley attracts me.

Prompt - Application 2 (Rejected):
Practicing commercial law converges my intellectual curiosity and entrepreneurial spirit. While facilitating the funding of businesses at an angel investing syndicate and a search fund, I was impressed by how partners flexibly applied their commercial acumen to mitigate the multivariate risks of each venture. This inspired me to understand the life cycles of entrepreneurial deals by emulating their versatile commercial problem-solving. I applied this through an advisory lens at Mayer Brown, where I enjoyed counselling financial players on supply chain disruptions. This further fascinated me by elucidating how effective transactional lawyers tangibly mould the corporate landscape of the future.

Sidley’s award-winning finance practice impresses me as an elevation of the deals that first drew me to commercial law – promising to motivate me through the profound scale and effect of my work. Associate Dhevine Chandrapala’s description of Sidley’s lawyers as ‘commercial advisors’ further resonates with my entrepreneurial inclinations, as evident through the unique approaches I used to double the profitability of both LSE’s BJJ and Commercial Awareness societies. As a self-directed learner, the small teams and early responsibility that associate Cyril Cutinha describes provide the horizontal, entrepreneurial environment where I will be constantly challenged to grow – and thus sustainably advances my drive to cultivate an adaptable commercial perspective.

Moreover, Sidley’s support of YMCA youths complements my values, having led volunteer mentorship programmes for underprivileged students for four years. This compounds the collegiate atmosphere that associate Sam Walker illustrates, to create a culture where I can authentically contribute using my people-driven personality.


Completion - Application 2 (Successful):
*Inferred points contributing to the rejection of Application 2:*

- *General Commercial Awareness:* The application discusses an interest in the general practice of commercial law but lacks specific insights into Sidley's unique strengths and specific cases, unlike Application 1’s detailed mention of the GIC’s $8.4b leveraged buyout.
- *Lack of Detailed Experience:* Experience at Mayer Brown and with angel investing syndicates is mentioned without concrete legal examples or specific tasks, missing the depth and relevance of legal experience seen in Application 1.
- *Superficial Firm-Specific Engagement:* Mentions interactions with associates Dhevine Chandrapala, Cyril Cutinha, and Sam Walker, but these are less detailed and fail to provide rich firm-specific insights or events engagement as seen in Application 1.
- *Generic Philanthropic Links:* References to YMCA support and volunteer mentorship aren’t directly tied to Sidley's core business practices, lacking the clear connection to Sidley's specific strengths and client work that Application 1 demonstrated.
- *Absence of Industry-Specific Knowledge:* Does not showcase deep industry-specific knowledge or relevant certifications, unlike Application 1's detailed industry insight and connections to legal implications in FinTech through IBM’s Data Science Course.

Prompt - Application 3 (Rejected):
My desire to become a commercial lawyer is derived from my internships at commercial law firms. At Latham & Watkins, I completed Trainee tasks on an M&A transaction. I enjoyed the investigative nature of the researching task involved with conducting due diligence because it allowed me to experience real client work. Likewise, at Kirkland & Ellis, I saw how commercial lawyers fuse business considerations within their legal advice. Having learnt this, I competed in the Aspiring Solicitors Commercial Awareness Competition 2021/22, where I finished in the top 4% of over 3000 candidates. 

Sidley’s expertise in private equity combined with the small Trainee intake is what enticed my application. At a networking event in 2022, Chloe Francis explained how transactional law is heavily associated with business cycles. Therefore, lawyers must deliver practical solutions at pace. As a former Royal Navy Cadet, I have experience working under pressure to deliver results in a small team. Accordingly, I look forward to the independent thinking Sidley expects from their Trainees. Additionally, lean teams will allow me to work closely and learn from recognised legal experts such as Adam Runcorn and Fatema Orjela. 

I have a keen interest in the private equity industry because of its high growth and sector-agnostic characteristic. Specifically, Sidley’s full-service capability allows them to advise on transactions ranging from the acquisition of Chelsea football club to the acquisition of DoodleLearning. Thus, it’s the dynamic working environment obtained from Sidley’s diversified client base which is the standout feature of the firm.

Completion - Application 3 (Rejected):
*Inferred points contributing to the rejection of Application 3:*

- *General Commercial Awareness:* The applicant describes interest in M&A transactions and general experiences but lacks specific insights into Sidley's unique strengths and high-profile cases, unlike the detailed deal mention in Application 1.
- *Lack of Detailed Experience:* Tasks at Latham & Watkins and Kirkland & Ellis are noted but without concrete examples or detailed tasks, missing the depth and specific legal tasks highlighted in Application 1.
- *Superficial Firm-Specific Engagement:* Mentions networking event with Chloe Francis but lacks depth and specificity in engagement details and firm-specific insight seen in Application 1.
- *Generic Interest and Capabilities:* An interest in the diversified client base and small team dynamics is mentioned but does not strongly link these aspects to Sidley's unique strengths or detail how this specifically benefits the applicant’s career, as effectively done in Application 1.
- *Absence of Industry-Specific Knowledge:* Although the applicant mentions interest in private equity, they do not demonstrate specific industry knowledge or certifications, unlike the detailed knowledge and industry connections in Application 1.

Prompt - Application 4 (Successful):
I am attracted to commercial law because of the blend between technical expertise and big-picture thinking. In my degree, I most enjoy applying the law to novel scenarios. At Duncan Lewis, I shadowed an unfair dismissals case and was intrigued by how the legal decision unsettled the working culture and led to poor business performance. Commercial lawyers combine these activities as they need to anticipate market changes while using the law to help manage a client company’s risk. 
I am attracted to Sidley both because of its values and attitude towards growth. After attending Sidley’s BME Open Day, it was clear that your firm’s inclusive culture aligns with my personality. I saw how initiatives, like the Committee on Retention and Promotion of Women, provide support for underrepresented groups. In Year 13, I headed a free GCSE tuition scheme for disadvantaged students whilst at University I organised the Sikh Society ACCESS conference. Therefore, I believe this is a working culture where I would thrive but also be able to contribute toward. At the Cambridge University Sidley dinner, Neils Gravenhorst explained that Sidley has recently used its expertise in life sciences and insurance to build out its private equity team through strategic lateral hires. On the open day, partner Fatema Orjela emphasised that these growing teams in the London office aren’t clouded by the historical weight carried by other firms. This excited me as it means that lawyers are encouraged to contribute to the team’s business direction at an early stage. 
Completion - Application 4 (Successful):
*Inferred points contributing to the success of Application 4:*

Some key points to bear in mind:
1) Highlight the inferred patterns or specific issues in the rejected applications and positive aspects/successes in the accepted applications. Use all the prompt-completion pairs to do so. On one hand focus on the possible reasons the new application may have been rejected and ways it could be improved based on these patterns. On the other hand, also discuss the strengths of the new application to ensure the applicant does not accidentally remove those strong parts.

2) Tailor your feedback on the new application to be as data-driven as possible. Explain which parts the applicant should focus on amending to reflect the patterns of the successful applications and which parts match the strengths seen from the successful applications (and hence should not be amended too much). Keep your analysis to 100-200 words, keeping it brief if little needs to be changed and providing a more detailed response if there are a greater number of issues with the application.

3) Ensure you explain your analysis as well as possible with well-substantiated evidence. Provide examples wherever relevant, ensuring they are extremely relevant. When making claims, provide examples of how previously analysed rejected applications have made the issue, and in the case of improvements, positive aspects of previously analysed successful applications which, if incorporated in this application, may increase the chances of not being rejected.

4) When making suggestions as to how the application could be improved, reference how a successful application did so based on the applications you remember, using quotations only where relevant.

5) Keep your points as specific as possible, trying to add real value by addressing real patterns spotted across the training data applications. Ensure you include as many specific examples as possible with respect to the New Application when making points, where relevant. Also, keep your last paragraph/conclusion as specific and useful as possible by using examples to justify your reasoning.

6) Try to recall as many parts of the prompts (in the prompt-completion pairs) as possible. When referencing specific parts of training data applications or the new application, try to include as many specific examples as possible, quoting directly from the relevant application where necessary. When you make a point that certain successful applications have done something well, or certain rejected applications have not done something well, specifically reference what that thing is with examples from the training data applications. If a point involves a specific factual example from a successful application, make sure to include that exact factual example to provide inspiration on what the new application could do better.

7) Given the 250-word limit, identify which parts of the new application require the most change to reflect the most common patterns observed in successful applications. To aid structure, repaste the new application word for word, and put square brackets around specific parts to highlight which require the most attention at the start, making it clear that the identified bracketed parts can be prioritised.

8) Provide your response in a readable way. Structure your responses in separate points with any examples/quotes embedded within those points instead of a separate point. Write in prose and include sub-headings to signpost your points well.

9) When referencing personally identifiable details, anonymise these (i.e names, specific schools etc...). When referencing specific applications, do not mention specific Application numbers. Only reference 'successful' or 'rejected' applications.

Format all points in this structure:

[Outline issue/point]:
[Explain issue/point] with evidence from rejected applications: [Insert quote/example] and improvement suggestion [insert improvement suggestion].

(Repeat for each point)
