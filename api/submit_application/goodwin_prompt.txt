Goodwin exposes trainees to all investment life-cycle stages from fund formation to exits. However, Goodwin’s focus on innovative start-ups especially excites me. I cultivated this interest through my summer internship at a boutique consultancy wherein I reviewed contractual documents for healthcare and tech companies seeking private capital investment. I hope to continue mine, and Goodwin’s, emphasis on cultivating entrepreneurship through law.

Goodwin’s prominent technology and life sciences practice drives my application.

It was through a conversation with Arjun at an Aspiring Solicitors law fair which sparked an interest in Goodwin. He spoke on the firm’s pre-eminence in advising clients in the startup scene such as Zapp, which paired with the private equity and antitrust capability on offer attracts me to train here.

 

The firm’s relatively smaller trainee intake paired with the rapid growth the London office is experiencing makes for a nimble environment to train in, having substantive deal team involvement.

The ‘start-up’ energy and upstart nature of your expanding firm proves to be highly attractive, alongside your prominent private equity practice. In seeking to grow, Goodwin constantly finds itself on the precipice of ground-breaking work with tech/life sciences start-ups, which is rather fitting for an emerging law firm. This proves to be highly enticing and I am keen to train in such a closely-knit firm of 200 lawyers with a limited trainee intake, due to the prospect of: greater responsibilities/deal involvement; dynamism within lean and efficient teams; and functional but limited hierarchies to maximise interactions between senior and junior lawyers.

 

Completion - Application 20 (Rejected):

This answer gets some things right, but uses too many buzzwords.

 

1) The recruiter would have looked even more favourably upon specific experiences (e.g. experiences with ‘tech/life sciences’ firms) that show the applicant is truly interested in the kinds of mandates Goodwin takes on.

 

2) Further, the phrases ‘start-up energy’ and ‘upstart nature’ of Goodwin’s ‘expanding firm’ are not concrete reasons for a recruiter to be satisfied of the applicant’s interest in the firm. They are intangible reasons that anyone can claim without tangible justifications (i.e relevant experiences). The statement ‘Goodwin constantly finds itself on the precipice of ground-breaking work with tech/life sciences start-ups’ simply states what Goodwin is good at, but does not adequately address the issue of why the applicant is specifically interested in the firm (again linking back to the previous point about the need for relevant experiences).

 

3) The application also does not showcase directly relevant practical experience in Goodwin’s core sectors (technology, life sciences etc…).

 

4) There is also no mention of Goodwin’s DEI initiatives - successful applications explicitly aligned with Goodwin’s DEI values, showing commitment to diversity and inclusion.

 

5) This is not to say that the applicant has made irrelevant points, indeed the ‘greater responsibilities/deal involvement’, ‘lean and efficient teams’ and ‘functional but limited hierarchies’ may be relevant reasons for joining Goodwin. However, the applicant needs to show interactions with the firm (e.g. Open Days or Insight Events) to justify such ‘cultural reasons’, as these intangible reasons can only be justified through in-person networking with the firm’s representative. If there are none to show, the applicant is better off sticking to practical, concrete examples that align with the firm’s training style (e.g. high-paced environments where the applicant may have had to previously take on greater responsibility).

Goodwin attracts me for its unique ability, compared to any other city international law firm, to assist small to medium businesses and entrepreneurs. At Jones Day, I enjoyed helping venture capital and start-ups by completing checklists and commercial due diligence. Goodwin’s uniqueness will enable me to be exposed to a plethora of business processes and developments, becoming so a holistic corporate lawyer. Additionally, Goodwin’s growth through its numerous lateral hires such as Arvin Abraham, would accelerate my professional development through exposure to experts in their field. Lastly, as a black woman, I am impressed by Goodwin's 2023 Compass Award recognition.

Some key points to bear in mind:

1) Highlight the inferred patterns or specific issues in the rejected applications and positive aspects/successes in the accepted applications. Use all the prompt-completion pairs to do so. On one hand focus on the possible reasons the new application may have been rejected and ways it could be improved based on these patterns. On the other hand, also discuss the strengths of the new application to ensure the applicant does not accidentally remove those strong parts.

 

2) Tailor your feedback on the new application to be as data-driven (based on the past applications from the MemoryKey) as possible. Explain which parts the applicant should focus on amending to reflect the patterns of the successful applications and which parts match the strengths seen from the successful applications (and hence should not be amended too much). Keep your analysis to 100-200 words, keeping it brief if little needs to be changed and providing a more detailed response if there are a greater number of issues with the application.

 

3) Ensure you explain your analysis as well as possible with well-substantiated evidence. Provide examples wherever relevant, ensuring they are extremely relevant. When making claims, provide examples of how previously analysed rejected applications have made the issue, and in the case of improvements, positive aspects of previously analysed successful applications which, if incorporated in this application, may increase the chances of not being rejected.

 

4) When making suggestions as to how the application could be improved, reference how a successful application did so based on the applications you remember through the memory key, using quotations only where relevant.

 

5) Keep your points as specific as possible, trying to add real value by addressing real patterns spotted across the training data applications. Ensure you include as many specific examples as possible with respect to the New Application when making points, where relevant. Also, keep your last paragraph/conclusion as specific and useful as possible by using examples to justify your reasoning.

 

6) Try to recall as many parts of the prompts (in the prompt-completion pairs) as possible. When referencing specific parts of training data applications or the new application, try to include as many specific examples as possible, quoting directly from the relevant application where necessary. When you make a point that certain successful applications have done something well, or certain rejected applications have not done something well, specifically reference what that thing is with examples from the training data applications. If a point involves a specific factual example from a successful application, make sure to include that exact factual example to provide inspiration on what the new application could do better.

 

7) Given the 100-word limit, identify which parts of the new application require the most change to reflect the most common patterns observed in successful applications. To aid structure, repaste the new application word for word, and put square brackets around specific parts to highlight which require the most attention at the start, making it clear that the identified bracketed parts can be prioritised.

 

8) Provide your response in a readable way. Structure your responses in separate points with any examples/quotes embedded within those points instead of a separate point. Write in prose and include sub-headings to signpost your points well.

 

9) When referencing personally identifiable details, anonymise these (i.e names, specific schools etc...). When referencing specific applications, do not mention specific Application numbers. Only reference 'successful' or 'rejected' applications.

 

Format all points in this structure:

 

[Outline issue/point]:

[Explain issue/point] with evidence from rejected applications: [Insert quote/example] and improvement suggestion [insert improvement suggestion].

 

(Repeat for each point)
