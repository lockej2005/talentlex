-------------You are a recruiter at the law firm Goodwin Procter in the London office that screens applications for vacation schemes and shortlists them. You have reviewed several applications and shorlisted/rejected them. Based on your experience, infer the reasons why the New Application has been rejected, identifying patterns that would have likely led to applications being rejected or accepted.

-------------Below are some applications you have reviewed and their analyses:

Application 1:
This application was rejected

The ‘start-up’ energy and upstart nature of your expanding firm proves to be highly attractive, alongside your prominent private equity practice. In seeking to grow, Goodwin constantly finds itself on the precipice of ground-breaking work with tech/life sciences start-ups, which is rather fitting for an emerging law firm. This proves to be highly enticing and I am keen to train in such a closely-knit firm of 200 lawyers with a limited trainee intake, due to the prospect of: greater responsibilities/deal involvement; dynamism within lean and efficient teams; and functional but limited hierarchies to maximise interactions between senior and junior lawyers.

Review:
This answer gets some things right, but uses too many buzzwords.\n\n1) The recruiter would have looked even more favourably upon specific experiences (e.g. experiences with ‘tech/life sciences’ firms) that show the applicant is truly interested in the kinds of mandates Goodwin takes on.\n\n2) Further, the phrases ‘start-up energy’ and ‘upstart nature’ of Goodwin’s ‘expanding firm’ are not concrete reasons for a recruiter to be satisfied of the applicant’s interest in the firm. They are intangible reasons that anyone can claim without tangible justifications (i.e relevant experiences). The statement ‘Goodwin constantly finds itself on the precipice of ground-breaking work with tech/life sciences start-ups’ simply states what Goodwin is good at, but does not adequately address the issue of why the applicant is specifically interested in the firm (again linking back to the previous point about the need for relevant experiences).\n\n3) The application also does not showcase directly relevant practical experience in Goodwin’s core sectors (technology, life sciences etc…).\n\n4) There is also no mention of Goodwin’s DEI initiatives - successful applications explicitly aligned with Goodwin’s DEI values, showing commitment to diversity and inclusion.\n\n5) This is not to say that the applicant has made irrelevant points, indeed the ‘greater responsibilities/deal involvement’, ‘lean and efficient teams’ and ‘functional but limited hierarchies’ may be relevant reasons for joining Goodwin. However, the applicant needs to show interactions with the firm (e.g. Open Days or Insight Events) to justify such ‘cultural reasons’, as these intangible reasons can only be justified through in-person networking with the firm’s representative. If there are none to show, the applicant is better off sticking to practical, concrete examples that align with the firm’s training style (e.g. high-paced environments where the applicant may have had to previously take on greater responsibility).

Goodwin exposes trainees to all investment life-cycle stages from fund formation to exits. However, Goodwin’s focus on innovative start-ups especially excites me. I cultivated this interest through my summer internship at a boutique consultancy wherein I reviewed contractual documents for healthcare and tech companies seeking private capital investment. I hope to continue mine, and Goodwin’s, emphasis on cultivating entrepreneurship through law. Goodwin’s practice area strengths appeal to me. In particular, Trainee Apsana Rai and I discussed Goodwin’s sector-focused approach. The firm’s life sciences and technology expertise support its private equity (PE) growth strategies, therefore winning a Chambers Band 1 ranking.

Review:
This application may seem like it ticks all the boxes in terms of mentioning Goodwin’s key strengths, however it is not personal enough. It does not adequately answer why the applicant is personally interested in Goodwin.\n\n1) Throughout the application, the applicant merely states facts about Goodwin to sound impressive. These facts are not linked to the applicant’s personal experiences enough. For example, the applicant simply states that ‘Goodwin exposes trainees to all life-cycle stages’, whilst its focus on ‘innovative start-ups’ especially excites the applicant. Rejected applications often mentioned broad experiences without demonstrating specific relevance - for example, one rejected application mentioned ‘helping venture capital and start-ups by completing checklists and commercial due diligence’ without tying it directly to Goodwin’s practices (i.e life sciences, technology, private equity). Inspiration could be taken from one successful application which provided a more specific example of the applicant’s internship where they aligned their experiences with the firm’s work with Moderna.\n\n2) The application has no mention of any DEI commitment, which is a common theme among successful applications. Whilst such a statement may not guarantee the application going through, it maximises the success of this particular response (to the question ‘Why Goodwin’). A constructive way of doing this may be to link the applicant’s personal background with Goodwin’s diversity initiatives, for example its Affinity Groups ‘BOLD@Goodwin’, ‘CRED@Goodwin’, ‘Pride@Goodwin’ and ‘Women@Goodwin’. Another successful application mentioned Goodwin’s Compass Award which reflected their own values (being a black woman).\n\n3) This application does not utilise name-dropping effectively. The applicant mentions their interaction with a Trainee in discussing the firm’s ‘sector-focused approach’, but again does not tie this into their personal experiences. The applicant then proceeds to briefly mention the firm’s strengths in private equity, and although mentioning Goodwin’s Chambers Band 1 Ranking may illustrate research, it should be expanded on as it is also a key area of Goodwin’s focus in addition to technology and life sciences.\n\n4) Strength: This application does however get one thing right - the applicant is definitely aware of the firm’s focus on innovative start-ups and its life-sciences and technology expertise which shows sector awareness. One successful application took this a step further by mentioning their time at a biotech start-up where they ‘helped decide how to monetise the company’s intellectual property’. Application 19 took a different approach, albeit still successful, by mentioning a case-study which showed much more detailed sector awareness (the example there was reading about Goodwin’s role in ‘Frazier Healthcare Partners’ $1.525 billion sale of Parata Systems, a pharmacy technology solutions provider)’. So whilst this current applicant’s sector awareness is a good starting point, more specific examples should be given to align better with the successful applications.

This application was rejected
Goodwin's strong focus on technology, exemplified by its innovative Proptech practice, is a compelling reason for my application. As an international student taking substantial risks to pursue a legal career 6000 miles from home, the firm's dedication to cutting-edge areas justifies those risks and propels me to contribute to this field. Furthermore, I am fascinated by Goodwin's client-centric approach, strategically locating its offices in areas that align with its strengths. I appreciate this commitment to exceptional legal services, as I learned to adapt my work priorities based on client needs during my internship with Pro Bono SG this summer.

Review:
The applicant does not tie their experiences and interests to Goodwin core sectors enough (i.e life sciences, tech etc...). While the applicant's experiences may seem personalized, many of the experiences are not relevant to the question asking why the applicant is specifically applying to Goodwin.\n\n1) The applicant's mention of being an ‘international student taking substantial risks to pursue a legal career 6000 miles from home’ is not relevant to why they are applying to Goodwin specifically. It does not convey the applicant's interest in life sciences, tech, real estate or private equity, all of which are key strengths of Goodwin's. While Goodwin's recruiter may appreciate the applicant taking a risk applying for a legal career 6000 miles from home, it sounds like a superficial motivation for applying to the firm and may not seem genuine.\n\n2) The applicant mentioning Goodwin's ‘client-centric approach, strategically locating its offices in areas that align with its strengths’ is again too generic and not personalized enough. A better response would have been to articulate why this client-centric approach appeals to the applicant - it may be due to the applicant's desire to work closely with tech/life science clients for example, which could be backed up with personal experiences in the relevant sector.\n\n3) Throughout the application, the applicant uses very generic language, such as ‘cutting-edge areas’, ‘compelling reason for my application’ and ‘I am fascinated by’. Better language to use would have been a) specific references to which cutting-edge areas the applicant is interested in (i.e tech, life sciences, real estate or private equity), b) writing more concisely by saying ‘I am applying to Goodwin, because...’ or ‘My application stems from...’, conserving word count and c) removing ‘fascinated’ and using more personal language such as ‘resonated with’.\n\n4) The last point, regarding the applicant's experiences adapting work priorities is the best portion of the application, because it is the most personal example that actually mirrors a skill that would be expected of a Goodwin trainee. Nonetheless, the link to Goodwin could be better improved by referencing how the applicant would be suited for the fast-paced demands of the job, using their skills gained from the experience at Pro Bono SG to do so. Another angle which may have been helpful could be linking this pro bono experience to Goodwin’s pro bono work, however this is not the priority and should only be done if it can fit the 100-word limit.

I have an interest in pharmaceutical and technology transactions after researching how the medical industry will be transformed due to the introduction of AI in the drug discovery process helping to develop personalised medicines. At Goodwin, I would be able to explore Life Sciences across multiple legal practices, from advising on contentious IP and regulatory issues, to assisting biotech spinouts sell their businesses to pharmaceutical companies. I would gain exposure to entrepreneurial start-ups, developing my interest in growth equity venture capital and private equity, where other firms cannot offer this variety of legal practices in Technology and Life Sciences.

Review:
The reason this application did not get shortlisted is likely to boil down to a lack of personal experiences mentioned that link to Goodwinʼs key strengths.\n\n1) The applicant mentions loads of Goodwinʼs strengths such as Life Sciences, IP and private equity, but does not actually mention any experiences that illustrate interest in those areas. Whilst it may seem relevant that the applicant has researched how the medical industry will be transformed due to the introduction of AI in the drug discovery process, this is not linked to Goodwin at the onset. A better approach would have been to mention a deal Goodwin has done in this space, or a specific experience of the applicantʼs that links to AI and drug-discovery.\n\n2) That being said, the applicant certainly grasps what Goodwin is good at and it is clear they have researched the firmʼs sector-focus. Making the application more personalised would have taken the application to the next level and improved the chances of being shortlisted.

Application 5:
This application was rejected
Goodwin’s market-leading focus on technology and life-sciences startups incorporates the exciting venture-based financing deals that first drew me to commercial law. Specifically, the distinguishing integrated practice that trainee George Fagan described would provide me both target and investor-side exposure throughout a company’s maturation. This would help me understand how my contributions synergise with the overarching deals, accelerating my personal and professional growth. Moreover, incoming trainee Bennett Jones highlighted the adaptable and friendly environment at Goodwin, which complements my self-directed learning style. Leveraging the approachability of senior colleagues would quickly enable me to emulate their expertise and cultivate meaningful working relationships.

Review:
This application uses plenty of buzzwords, and whilst it does mention some of Goodwin’s key strengths, it does not link these to the applicant’s relevant experiences enough.\n\n1) The applicant mentioned being interested in Goodwin’s exciting work with venture-based financing deals, and working with both targets and investors. This would have been better backed up with some personal experiences work with venture financiers or any of Goodwin’s other clients.\n\n2) The rest of the application does not actually suffer from any great flaws. It mentions interactions with the firm engagingly (by mentioning interacting with Trainee George Fagan for example). However mentioning future trainees should be avoided - it would have been better to mention an actual trainee or talk about a different point altogether as opposed to mentioning ‘incoming trainee’ Bennett Jones, because incoming trainees have not actually fully experienced the firm’s culture yet, so are unlikely to have a complete grasp on how it is like working at the firm as an actual trainee.\n\n3) The applicant mentions being able to learn from senior colleagues which is a great example, but does not necessarily answer the question ‘Why Goodwin’. The applicant should be as focused as possible on what their reasons are for applying to Goodwin specifically, and the best way to do this is by mentioning Goodwin’s key sector-strengths like a lot of the successful applications have done.

Firstly, Goodwin’s sector expertise in life sciences and technology attracts me as I am excited at the prospect of helping innovative companies prosper across their lifecycle stages. Recently, facilitating a med-tech founder’s Series A round as an investment firm’s summer intern cultivated my interest in start-ups. Secondly at Goodwin’s Open Day, hearing how Trainee Alice Bennett received associate-level responsibilities within her lean deal teams convinced me Goodwin’s entrepreneurial environment would accelerate my career development as a trainee. Finally, as an ethnic minority and a part of SEO London, Goodwin’s emphasis on DEI, given its Mansfield certification, aligns with my values.

Review:
This application does several things well: it links Goodwin’s sector expertise to the applicant’s personal experiences well, it mentions DEI effectively and it articulates why the applicant would be a good fit for the firm’s working culture.\n\n1) The applicant mentions their experience working with a Series A med-tech founder which exemplifies one of the main kinds of mandates Goodwin works on, as Goodwin works closely with med-tech/life science founders. This is a great example of why the applicant would enjoy training at Goodwin, through a very tailored example. Further, the applicant mentions Goodwin’s focus on helping start-ups prosper at the start of the response which is a good signpost for the rest of the application.\n\n2) The applicant mentions an interaction with the firm in a relevant way, without simply ‘name-dropping’ a contact’s name. Mentioning an event through which the applicant connected with Goodwin shows genuine curiosity to learn more about Goodwin’s culture. Typically, a generic mention of the firm’s culture may be considered superficial, however done in this way (relevant and specific), it is a strength.\n\n3) Lastly, the application mentions DEI in a very personable way, linking a specific example of Goodwin’s DEI focus (i.e the Mansfield certification) to the applicant’s experiences (as an ethnic minority and a part of SEO London, which is an organisation that supports diversity of the legal profession).\n\nOverall, this is a very strong application.

Goodwin's comprehensive coverage of the private equity life cycle, from fund structuring to buyouts, resonates with my background in private equity and venture capital. Particularly, Partner Gretchen Scott's insights about Goodwin's tech-focused approach during the insight day and its work with startups and venture capitals mirror my experience at Microsoft's venture arm, where I closely collaborated with cutting-edge tech startups, especially AI-powered SaaS companies. Goodwin's strong private equity practice and tech orientation offer an ideal platform for me to leverage and expand my knowledge in these sectors.

Review:
One of the main reasons the applicant likely got shortlisted is because of their very specific mention of relevant experiences that link to Goodwin’s sector focus.\n\n1) The applicant mentions very specific experiences such as working with AI-powered SaaS companies which are some of Goodwin’s key clients. Further, the applicant’s background in private equity and venture capital links heavily to Goodwin’s key corporate focus on investment funds (both venture capital and private equity).\n\n2) The applicant displays a genuine curiosity to learn about the firm’s practices through their mention of interacting with Partner Gretchen Scott during the insight day.\n\nThe applicant clearly had a genuine intention in applying to Goodwin given their very specific experiences that linked with the firm’s strengths.

Applying to Goodwin is an opportunity to gain an in-depth understanding of what drives your success and to be a part of a firm whose values closely align with mine. Being the director of a non-profit organization that provides free application mentoring to Malaysian sixth-form students, long-term success and improvement are goals I work towards. Your 10 Core Principles show that striving for the best in every area of the firm is at the forefront of every decision; hence, it is no surprise that Goodwin was named Editor's Choice Law Firm 2023 by the British Legal Awards.

Review:
This application is not necessarily the strongest of applications, but still got shortlisted. It may have got shortlisted due to some exceptional experiences, exceptional grades or other circumstances. Nonetheless, there are some strengths that can be picked out.\n\n1) The applicant’s main strength comes from linking their competencies to Goodwin’s values. This includes linking their leadership position mentoring students as part of a non-profit with Goodwin’s 10 Core Principles which are 1) firm first, 2) diverse, inclusive, equitable, 3) client-centric to the core, 4) everyone’s a leader, 5) collaborative, 6) our baseline is excellence, 7) comfortable with the uncomfortable, :sunglasses: culturally vibrant, 9) financially sound and 10) playing the long game.\n\n2) Whilst the application got, the first part of the application could be improved. Mentioning the opportunity to ‘gain an ‘in-depth understanding of what drives your [Goodwin’s] success’ and to join a firm ‘whose values closely align with [the applicant’s}’ can be a great signpost, but could be made more concise.\n\n3) The applicant mentions a firm-specific researched example in a relevant way to the applicant’s experiences (the Editor’s Choice Law Firm 2023 by the British Legal Awards). Some unsuccessful applications would have simply name-dropped an example without tailoring it to the applicant’s experiences.\n\nOverall, the applicant displays a strong connection to Goodwin’s competencies, and it may be possible that they have mentioned more specific sector-focused experiences elsewhere. Hence, it cannot be said this this application alone has led to the applicant’s success. The key strengths should be taken forward on how to link one’s experiences to Goodwin’s competencies and values.

Goodwin’s prominent technology and life sciences practice drives my application. This interest stems from my time at a biotech start-up, where I helped decide how to monetise the company’s intellectual property. This blend of law and science appeals to me, as it requires an appreciation of cutting-edge technology as well as creative legal problem solving. Lucy Charlton’s discussion of this at Goodwin’s Open Day was fascinating. The firm’s breadth of expertise, from private equity to intellectual property, allows it to advise companies throughout their lifecycle. I am attracted by the notion of helping clients grow from start-up to large cap.

Review:
This is a very strong application that links tons of specific Goodwin-related examples to the applicant’s personal experiences.\n\n1) The applicant mentions their time at a bio-tech startup helping to monetise the company’s IP which is a key focus for Goodwin. IP and life sciences are key practice areas, illustrating how the applicant would thrive at Goodwin. It also shows genuine interest in Goodwin’s work.\n\n2) The applicant mentions an interaction with the firm in a relevant way. Usually, where an applicant says a certain interaction was ‘fascinating’ it may sound superficial, however the applicant links the interaction with Lucy Charlton to Goodwin’s focus on law and science, after having already linked this to their previous personal experience. This is much more engaging and tells the recruiter the applicant is genuinely interested in applying to the firm.\n\n3) The theme of helping companies grow from start-up to large cap is one strength Goodwin does well.\n\nThis is a very strong application with a very efficient use of words to convey relevant experiences that link to Goodwin’s sector-focus.

It was through a conversation with Arjun at an Aspiring Solicitors law fair which sparked an interest in Goodwin. He spoke on the firm’s pre-eminence in advising clients in the startup scene such as Zapp, which paired with the private equity and antitrust capability on offer attracts me to train here. The firm’s relatively smaller trainee intake paired with the rapid growth the London office is experiencing makes for a nimble environment to train in, having substantive deal team involvement. The opportunity to nurture a close-knit network at a leading firm therefore is a desirable learning environment to be in.

Review:
The substantive points this application makes are not necessarily wrong, but they are backed up with insufficient evidence.\n\n1) For example, the applicant mentions being attracted to working with ‘clients in the startup scene’ as well as ‘private equity and antitrust’. However, no specific personal experiences related to these sectors are provided to justify such an attraction. Many successful applicants have tended to have experiences in these backgrounds (such as venture capital, life sciences, or private equity, which is a non-exhaustive list); however, this is not to say that those who did not succeed lacked such experiences—they may have had other commendable aspects (such as top grades or attending top universities like Oxford and Cambridge). For the purposes of this analysis, to maximize this applicant’s chances of success regardless of other parts of their application, it would have been better to focus on key practice areas (whether that be tech, private equity, or any other areas) and provide specific experiences to illustrate genuine interest in the types of mandates Goodwin receives from its clients. One successful application included a directly relevant experience by mentioning ‘facilitating a med-tech founder’s Series A round’ while another mentioned their ‘time at a biotech start-up’.\n\n2) The applicant could also reduce words and write more concisely. For example, avoiding unnecessary adverbs (i.e. the firm’s ‘relatively’ smaller trainee intake) and using clearer language. ‘Nimble environment’ could be tweaked to ‘fast-paced environment,’ but again this should be backed by an example where the applicant enjoyed such experiences (i.e., previous experiences in nimble, fast-paced environments, whether legal or non-legal).\n\n3) The applicant also makes no mention of Goodwin’s DEI initiatives or any personal relevance to Goodwin’s DEI goals, which is something successful applications did (i.e., ‘as an ethnic minority’).\n\n4) The application uses generic language, especially when mentioning the firm’s smaller trainee intake and network opportunities. Such generic language was present in another unsuccessful application which used phrases such as ‘startup energy’. To improve, the applicant should provide specific examples to illustrate fit and understanding, such as ‘smaller trainee intake, high responsibility’.

I am applying to Goodwin for two main reasons: firstly, its strong focus on technological innovation which strategically positions its lawyers at the intersection of technology, investors and emerging markets. I am excited at the chance of helping small corporations develop and blossom, supporting them in all the stages of their corporate lifecycle. Working in small fintech start-up companies like Serene as an R&D summer intern reinforced my interests in start-ups. Finally, Goodwin stands out for its commitment to diversity within the legal profession. As a black individual, I was impressed to see Goodwin win the Compass Award 2022.

Review:
The main reasons this application likely got shortlisted are due to its strong personal connection to Goodwin’s key strengths (i.e ‘technological innovation’ and ‘startups’). The applicant struck a good balance between mentioning Goodwin’ strengths and linking them back to the applicant’s personal experiences. The applicant is also part of an ethnic minority (i.e black), and given Goodwin’s DEI efforts, this may have incentivised them to shortlist the candidate.\n\n1) The applicant mentioning being excited at the prospect of working with small companies, and linking this to their experience with fintech start-ups is a great example of how to link one’s personal experiences to Goodwin’s strengths. This tells the recruiter that the applicant has a genuine motivation of working at the firm, and delivers authenticity in the application.\n\n2) The applicant also mentions Goodwin’s emphasis on tech innovation whilst mentioning their focus on investors and emerging markets. The applicant draws a great link between Goodwin’s strengths. Nonetheless, to really optimise the application this could still be made more explicit by specifically mentioning VC investors, specific tech clients (i.e AI) and specific emerging markets (i.e Middle-East and Asia). On the whole, the point is still solid.\n\n3) The applicant mentions Goodwin’s diversity focus and this is an important component of Goodwin’s corporate focus. An applicant mentioning DEI in an authentic way has a higher chance of getting through since the firm is actively looking to recruit a diverse talent pool. The applicant substantiated this by researching a specific niche example of Goodwin’s diversity focus, namely the Compass Award 2022, which nicely links personal experience/circumstances with the firm’s focus.\n\n4) Whilst the application got through, this is not to say that the applicant has perfected their application. It is a very strong application nonetheless, but could be slightly improved by mentioning more of Goodwin’s clientele in a specific way and more of Goodwin’s specific practice areas.

--------------Some key points to bear in mind:
1) Use all your experience on inferring the reasons the rejected applications have been rejected and the reasons the successful ones would have been successful. Discuss both the possible reasons the application could have been rejected based on all the patterns you have identified from your experience. Also discuss some key strengths (if any) of the New Application that the applicant should retain that match the patterns you've noticed across the successful applications you have reviewed.

2) Tailor your feedback on the new application to be as data-driven (based on the applications and the reviews given above) as possible. Explain which parts the applicant should focus on amending to reflect the patterns of the successful applications and which parts match the strengths seen from the successful applications (and hence should not be amended too much). Keep your analysis to 100-200 words, keeping it brief if little needs to be changed and providing a more detailed response if there are a greater number of issues with the application.

3) Ensure you explain your analysis as well as possible with well-substantiated evidence. Provide examples wherever relevant, ensuring they are extremely relevant. When providing examples, discuss how the rejected applications have made the issues identified and how successful applications have matched the strengths identified.

4) When making suggestions as to how the application could be improved, reference how a successful application did so based on the applications you remember through the above applications and the reviews, using quotations only where relevant.

5) Keep your points as specific as possible, trying to add real value by addressing real patterns spotted across the training data applications. Ensure you include as many specific examples as possible with respect to the New Application when making points, where relevant. Also, keep your last paragraph/conclusion as specific and useful as possible by using examples to justify your reasoning.

6) Try to recall as many parts of the prompts (in the above applications and their reviews) as possible. When referencing specific parts of training data applications or the new application, try to include as many specific examples as possible, quoting directly from the relevant application where necessary. When you make a point that certain successful applications have done something well, or certain rejected applications have not done something well, specifically reference what that thing is with examples from the training data applications. If a point involves a specific factual example from a successful application, make sure to include that exact factual example to provide inspiration on what the new application could do better.

7) Given the 100-word limit, identify which parts of the new application require the most change to reflect the most common patterns observed in successful applications.

9) When referencing personally identifiable details, anonymise these (i.e names, specific schools etc...). When referencing specific applications, do not mention specific Application numbers. Only reference 'successful' or 'rejected' applications.
