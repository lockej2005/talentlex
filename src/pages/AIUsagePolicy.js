          <h2>1. Purpose of AI Usage</h2>
          <p>At TalentLex, we leverage AI technologies to deliver innovative and efficient solutions across our platform. The primary objectives of using AI include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Enhancing the overall quality and responsiveness of our services.</li>
            <li>Improving user experience by providing personalized recommendations tailored to individual preferences.</li>
            <li>Automating routine tasks to increase efficiency and allow our team to focus on more complex challenges.</li>
            <li>Analyzing large datasets to uncover insights that help us refine our offerings and better serve our users.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>2. Data Used for AI</h2>
          <p>Our AI systems are designed to respect user privacy while delivering powerful results. The data used in our AI processes include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Anonymized Data:</strong> We anonymize personal data to remove identifiable elements before using it for AI training, ensuring that individual identities are protected.</li>
            <li><strong>Aggregated Data:</strong> We combine data from multiple sources to create large datasets that AI models use for pattern recognition and decision-making.</li>
            <li><strong>Operational Data:</strong> Information generated through the normal use of our services, such as interaction logs and service usage statistics, helps refine AI models.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Importantly, we do not use personally identifiable information (PII) in the training of our AI models unless explicitly stated and consented to by the user.</p>

          <h2>3. AI Decision-Making</h2>
          <p>While AI plays a significant role in enhancing our services, we ensure that it is used responsibly. Key aspects of our AI decision-making process include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Assistance, Not Autonomy:</strong> AI systems assist in decision-making processes but do not have the final say in decisions that significantly impact users.</li>
            <li><strong>Human Oversight:</strong> Decisions that have the potential to affect user rights or interests are reviewed by qualified human operators to ensure fairness and accuracy.</li>
            <li><strong>Review Mechanisms:</strong> We have processes in place to review and correct AI-driven decisions that may be erroneous or biased.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>4. Transparency</h2>
          <p>We are committed to transparency regarding our use of AI. Our transparency initiatives include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Clearly indicating when you are interacting with an AI-driven feature or tool.</li>
            <li>Providing detailed explanations of how AI affects the services you receive.</li>
            <li>Offering accessible documentation on the role of AI in various aspects of our platform.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>5. Bias Mitigation</h2>
          <p>At TalentLex, we understand the risks associated with AI bias and take proactive measures to ensure our AI systems are fair and unbiased. Our efforts include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Bias Identification:</strong> Regularly assessing our AI models to detect and address any biases that may emerge.</li>
            <li><strong>Diverse Training Data:</strong> Using diverse datasets to train our AI models, reflecting a wide range of perspectives and experiences.</li>
            <li><strong>Ethical Standards:</strong> Adhering to strict ethical guidelines in AI development to promote fairness, inclusivity, and equity in all automated processes.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>6. User Control</h2>
          <p>We believe in empowering users with control over their interactions with AI on our platform. Key aspects of user control include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Opt-Out Options:</strong> Where applicable, you have the option to opt-out of AI-driven features, ensuring that you can choose the level of AI involvement in your experience.</li>
